# Codebase Alignment Plan

**Objective:** Refactor the existing codebase to match the structure and conventions laid out in the official architecture documentation. This will align the project with its intended design, making future development more consistent and maintainable.

---

### 1. Introduce Nx Monorepo Tooling

*   **Action:** Add the Nx build system to the project. This includes adding the `nx` dependency to the root `package.json` and creating the main `nx.json` configuration file.
*   **Reason:** The architecture document specifies Nx as the tool for managing the monorepo. This is the foundational step that enables the rest of the refactoring.

### 2. Create New Directory Structure

*   **Action:** Create the `apps/` and `packages/` directories at the root of the project.
*   **Reason:** This establishes the primary folder structure required by the architecture document.

### 3. Relocate Applications

*   **Action:**
    *   Move the existing `observastack-app/frontend` code into the new `apps/frontend` directory.
    *   Move `observastack-app/bff` into a new `apps/backend` directory to match the documented naming convention.
*   **Reason:** This places the main applications in their correct, documented locations within the monorepo.

### 4. Centralize Shared Code

*   **Action:** Move the contents of the existing `observastack-app/contracts` directory into a new `packages/shared-types` directory.
*   **Reason:** This aligns with the architectural principle of centralizing shared code (like TypeScript interfaces) to be used by both the frontend and backend, preventing duplication and ensuring type safety.

### 5. Update Configuration & Verify

*   **Action:** Meticulously update all necessary configuration files (e.g., `package.json` scripts, `tsconfig.json` paths, import statements) to reflect the new directory structure. After the changes, run the project's build process and execute the test suite.
*   **Reason:** This is a critical step to ensure the application remains fully functional after the refactoring. We must verify that the applications still build, run, and pass all tests.

### 6. Cleanup

*   **Action:** Once the new structure is in place and fully verified, safely remove the now-empty `observastack-app` directory.
*   **Reason:** This completes the migration and removes the old, incorrect structure from the project.
