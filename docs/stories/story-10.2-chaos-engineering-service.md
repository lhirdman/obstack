# Story 10.2: Chaos Engineering Service for Resilience Testing

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** platform operator,
- **I want** a service that can inject controlled failures into the test environment,
- **so that** I can validate the platform's resilience and recovery mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A chaos engineering tool (e.g., Chaos Mesh or a custom script) is integrated into the test stack.
2.  Chaos "experiments" are created to simulate common failure scenarios (e.g., a database container failing, network latency between services, a pod being deleted).
3.  The Health Monitor service is used to observe the platform's reaction to the failure.
4.  The test passes if the platform remains functional (in a degraded state if necessary) and recovers gracefully once the failure condition is removed.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Integrate a chaos engineering tool into the test stack. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Create chaos experiments to simulate common failure scenarios. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Use the Health Monitor service to observe the platform's reaction to failures. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Ensure the test passes if the platform remains functional and recovers gracefully. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **Chaos Mesh** is the recommended tool for this story. It can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster where the test environment is running.
- The chaos experiments should be defined as YAML files and stored in a new `chaos-tests/` directory.
- The Test Runner service will be responsible for applying the chaos experiments and monitoring the results.
- The Health Monitor service will be critical for determining the impact of the chaos experiments.

### Testing
- This story is about creating resilience tests.
- The validation will be the successful execution of the chaos experiments and the observation of the platform's response.
- The tests should demonstrate that the platform can withstand common failures without catastrophic data loss or downtime.
