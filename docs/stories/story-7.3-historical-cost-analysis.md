# Story 7.3: Historical Cost Analysis

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** Pro plan customer,
- **I want** to view historical cost data and trends,
- **so that** I can understand how my costs are changing over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The backend is enhanced to query and store historical cost data from OpenCost into the PostgreSQL database.
2.  A new API endpoint is created to serve historical cost data with selectable time ranges.
3.  The "Cost Insights" UI is updated with a time-series chart showing cost trends.
4.  The UI allows users to compare costs across different time periods.
5.  This feature is protected by a `[SaaS]` feature flag.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Enhance the backend to query and store historical cost data in PostgreSQL. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Create a new API endpoint to serve historical cost data. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Update the "Cost Insights" UI with a time-series chart for cost trends. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Allow users to compare costs across different time periods in the UI. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Protect the feature with a `[SaaS]` feature flag. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- **[SaaS]** This is a SaaS/Pro plan feature.
- A new Alembic migration will be needed to create a table for storing historical cost data.
- A scheduled background job using **Celery** should be created to periodically fetch and store the cost data from OpenCost.
- The new API endpoint should support time range parameters (e.g., `start_date`, `end_date`).
- The feature flag should be checked on both the frontend and backend.

### Testing
- Backend tests for the Celery job to ensure it correctly fetches and stores data.
- Integration tests for the new historical cost API endpoint.
- Frontend component tests for the time-series chart and the time period comparison UI.
- E2E tests to verify the entire feature, including the feature flag logic.
