# Story 3.1: Backend Integration with Prometheus

## Status
- Done

## Story
- **As a** Backend Developer,
- **I want** the backend to query a Prometheus/Thanos instance based on the user's tenant,
- **so that** we can securely serve metrics data to the frontend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The backend provides a service that can connect to and query a Prometheus-compatible API.
2.  All PromQL queries sent from the backend are automatically injected with the `tenant_id` label to enforce data isolation.
3.  A new API endpoint is created (e.g., `/api/v1/metrics/query`) that proxies queries to Prometheus and returns the results.
4.  The endpoint is protected and requires a valid JWT.
5.  The new endpoint is documented in the API reference (Redocly).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Develop a backend service to connect and query a Prometheus-compatible API. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Ensure all outgoing PromQL queries are injected with the `tenant_id` label. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Create the `/api/v1/metrics/query` endpoint to proxy queries to Prometheus. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Secure the new endpoint, requiring a valid JWT. (AC: #4)
- [x] Task 5: Document the new endpoint in the Redocly API reference. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- The new metrics service should be located in `apps/backend/app/services/metrics_service.py`.
- Use a Python client library for Prometheus, such as `prometheus-api-client`.
- The `tenant_id` should be extracted from the user's JWT and used to inject a label matcher (e.g., `{tenant_id="..."}`) into every PromQL query. This is a critical security requirement.
- The Prometheus/Thanos API endpoint URL should be configurable via environment variables.

### Testing
- Create integration tests for the `/api/v1/metrics/query` endpoint.
- The tests should mock the Prometheus API.
- Test scenarios:
    - A valid query is correctly proxied and the `tenant_id` label is injected.
    - A query to an unprotected endpoint fails.
    - A query from a user in Tenant A does not return data for Tenant B.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The overall code quality is good, following a clean service-layer architecture. A critical security vulnerability was identified and fixed in the tenant_id injection logic. The test environment was also repaired to enable verification.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/backend/app/services/metrics_service.py`
  - **Change**: Reworked the `_inject_tenant_label` method to use a more robust regex and parsing logic.
  - **Why**: The original implementation had a bug that could lead to tenant data leakage on complex PromQL queries (e.g., those with a `by` clause). The new implementation correctly and safely injects the `tenant_id` without affecting other parts of the query.
  - **How**: The new logic correctly identifies metric names and avoids incorrectly modifying aggregation clauses.
- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/api/test_metrics_api.py`
  - **Change**: Added a new test case to specifically cover the complex query scenario that was previously failing.
  - **Why**: To ensure the security fix is effective and prevent future regressions.
  - **How**: The new test validates that a query with a `by (instance)` clause is correctly modified.
- **File**: `apps/backend/app/core/config.py`
  - **Change**: Updated Pydantic V1 syntax to V2.
  - **Why**: The project uses Pydantic V2, but the code was using deprecated V1 syntax, causing tests to fail.
  - **How**: Changed `from pydantic import BaseSettings` to `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings`.
- **File**: `apps/backend/tests/conftest.py`
  - **Change**: Hardcoded the path to the `alembic` executable in the virtual environment.
  - **Why**: The tests were failing because the `alembic` command was not in the PATH.
  - **How**: Changed `alembic` to the full path to the executable in the `venv`.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fixed critical security vulnerability.
- [x] Repaired test environment and verified fixes.
- [ ] Consider creating a centralized error handling middleware for FastAPI to reduce repetitive `try...except` blocks in the API endpoints.

### Security Review
- **CRITICAL**: A data leakage vulnerability was found and fixed in the `_inject_tenant_label` method. The fix has been verified by running the test suite.
