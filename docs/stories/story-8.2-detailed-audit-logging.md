# Story 8.2: Detailed Audit Logging

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** compliance officer,
- **I want** to view a detailed, immutable audit log of all significant user and system actions,
- **so that** I can meet our regulatory and security audit requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new `audit_logs` table is created in the PostgreSQL database.
2.  The backend includes a logging service that records key events (e.g., login, resource creation/deletion, permission change) to this table.
3.  The audit log includes the user, timestamp, action, and relevant metadata.
4.  A new API endpoint is created for querying the audit log with filters for user and date range.
5.  A new "Audit Log" view is added to the Admin section of the UI.
6.  This feature is protected by an `[Enterprise]` feature flag.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create the `audit_logs` table in the PostgreSQL database. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Develop a backend logging service to record key events. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure the audit log includes all required metadata. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Create an API endpoint for querying the audit log. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Add an "Audit Log" view to the Admin section of the UI. (AC: #5)
- [ ] Task 6: Protect the feature with an `[Enterprise]` feature flag. (AC: #6)

## Dev Notes
- **[Enterprise]** This is an enterprise-level feature.
- The `audit_logs` table should be designed to be append-only to ensure immutability. This can be enforced with database permissions.
- The logging service should be implemented as a middleware or a decorator that can be applied to the relevant API endpoints to automatically log actions.
- The metadata field should be a JSONB column to store flexible, context-specific information about the event.

### Testing
- Backend tests to ensure that actions on audited endpoints create the correct entries in the `audit_logs` table.
- Integration tests for the audit log query API, including its filtering capabilities.
- E2E tests for the "Audit Log" UI to verify that the logs are displayed correctly.
- Tests to verify that the feature is correctly hidden/disabled when the feature flag is off.
