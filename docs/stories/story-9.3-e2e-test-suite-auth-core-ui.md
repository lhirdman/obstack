# Story 9.3: E2E Test Suite for Authentication and Core UI

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** platform developer,
- **I want** an automated E2E test suite that validates the core authentication and UI navigation,
- **so that** I can ensure these critical user workflows never break.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  An E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) is added to the monorepo.
2.  The test runner is configured to execute E2E tests against the deployed test stack.
3.  Tests are created for: Local user registration, Local user login, Keycloak user login, and navigation between the main views (Logs, Metrics, etc.).
4.  The E2E tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add an E2E testing framework to the monorepo. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Configure the test runner to execute tests against the test stack. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Create E2E tests for authentication and core UI navigation. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Integrate the E2E tests into the CI/CD pipeline. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- As per the `tech-stack.md`, **Playwright** is the chosen E2E testing framework.
- The Playwright tests should be located in a new `e2e/` directory at the root of the monorepo.
- The Test Runner service created in Story 9.1 will be responsible for executing these tests.
- The CI/CD pipeline should be updated to trigger the Test Runner after a successful deployment to the test environment.

### Testing
- This story is about creating tests, so the validation will be the successful execution of these tests in the CI pipeline.
- The tests should be robust and reliable, with minimal flakiness.
- Test results should be stored in the Test Results Database.
