# Story 9.4: E2E Test Suite for Multi-Tenant Isolation

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** security engineer,
- **I want** an automated E2E test that proves a user from one tenant cannot access data from another,
- **so that** I can be confident in our core security model.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The test suite uses the Synthetic Data Generator to create data for at least two separate tenants (Tenant A and Tenant B).
2.  An E2E test logs in as a user from Tenant A.
3.  The test attempts to query for data belonging to Tenant B via the UI and API.
4.  The test passes if and only if all attempts to access Tenant B's data are correctly denied.
5.  This test is a blocking requirement for any production release.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Use the Synthetic Data Generator to create data for two separate tenants. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Create an E2E test that logs in as a user from Tenant A. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: In the test, attempt to query for data belonging to Tenant B. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Ensure the test passes only if access to Tenant B's data is denied. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story depends on **Story 9.2** (Synthetic Data Generator) and **Story 9.3** (E2E Test Suite Setup).
- This is a critical security test. The test should be thorough and attempt to access data through all available API endpoints (logs, metrics, traces, etc.).
- The test should be tagged as a "security" or "blocking" test in the test runner configuration.

### Testing
- The story itself is a test. The acceptance criteria are the test plan.
- The final validation is the consistent passing of this test in the CI/CD pipeline.
