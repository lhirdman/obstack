# Story 3.4: Frontend UI for Trace Visualization

## Status
- Ready for review

## Story
- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to view distributed traces in a waterfall diagram,
- **so that** I can debug performance issues and understand service dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Traces" view is created in the frontend.
2.  The UI allows users to search for traces by ID or other tags.
3.  When a trace is selected, the UI displays a detailed waterfall view of all spans.
4.  Each span in the waterfall is clickable and shows detailed metadata (tags, logs, etc.).
5.  The view is documented in the Docusaurus user guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create the new "Traces" view in the frontend. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Implement UI to search for traces by ID or other tags. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Display a detailed waterfall view for selected traces. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Make each span in the waterfall clickable to show detailed metadata. (AC: #4)
- [x] Task 5: Document the new Traces view in the Docusaurus user guide. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- The new "Traces" view should be a new page component in `apps/frontend/src/pages/TracesPage.tsx`.
- A dedicated UI component for rendering the waterfall diagram will be required. Consider using an existing library like `react-trace-viewer` or building a custom component using a charting library.
- The search functionality should query the backend's trace search endpoint (to be created in a future story). For now, searching by trace ID against the `/api/v1/traces/{trace_id}` endpoint is sufficient.
- Use **TanStack Query** for fetching trace data.

### Testing
- Component tests for the waterfall diagram are essential. Test with complex, nested trace data to ensure correct rendering.
- E2E tests should cover the workflow of searching for a trace ID and verifying that the waterfall diagram and span details are displayed correctly.

### Status
- Implementation Complete - Requires Testing and Validation

## QA Results
*This section is for the QA agent.*

### Review Date: 2025-08-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Rating**: Excellent
- **Summary**: The code for the trace visualization feature is well-structured, clean, and follows modern React best practices. Components are logically separated and the use of `tanstack-query` for data fetching is appropriate. The implementation is robust and meets all acceptance criteria.

### Test Execution Results
- **Status**: PASS (for this story's tests)
- **Summary**: All unit and E2E tests specifically written for the trace visualization feature (`TracesPage.test.tsx`, `traces.spec.ts`) pass successfully.
- **Traceability**:
  - AC #1 (New "Traces" view): Covered by E2E navigation tests.
  - AC #2 (Search for traces): Covered by unit and E2E tests for the search functionality.
  - AC #3 (Waterfall view): Covered by unit and E2E tests that verify the rendering of the waterfall.
  - AC #4 (Clickable spans): Covered by E2E tests that click on spans and verify details.
  - AC #5 (Documentation): Manually verified; documentation is comprehensive.

### Discovered Issues / Concerns
- **Concern**: While the tests for this story pass, the overall project test suite is still failing due to pre-existing issues (e.g., Vitest configuration, broken tests in other components). These issues are not blockers for this specific story but represent significant technical debt that should be addressed.

### Gate Status
- **Gate**: PASS
- **Gate File**: `docs/qa/gates/3.4-frontend-ui-trace-visualization.yml`

### Recommended Status
- [✔ Ready for Release]
