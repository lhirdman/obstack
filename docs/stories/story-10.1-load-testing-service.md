# Story 10.1: Load Testing Service for API and Data Ingestion

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** site reliability engineer,
- **I want** a service that can generate significant load against the platform's APIs and data ingestion endpoints,
- **so that** I can understand its performance characteristics and identify bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A load testing engine (e.g., k6, Locust) is added to the test stack.
2.  Test scripts are created to simulate realistic API usage patterns for multiple tenants.
3.  Test scripts are created to simulate high-volume data ingestion for logs, metrics, and traces.
4.  The load tests are configurable and can be triggered on demand.
5.  Performance results (response times, error rates, throughput) are collected and stored in the Test Results Database.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add a load testing engine to the test stack. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Create test scripts to simulate realistic API usage patterns. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Create test scripts to simulate high-volume data ingestion. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Make the load tests configurable and triggerable on demand. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Store performance results in the Test Results Database. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- **k6** is the recommended load testing tool for this project.
- The load testing scripts should be written in JavaScript and located in a new `load-tests/` directory.
- The Test Runner service will be configured to execute the k6 scripts.
- The scripts should be parameterized to allow for configurable load levels (e.g., number of virtual users, duration).
- The results should be output in a format that can be easily parsed and inserted into the Test Results Database.

### Testing
- This story is about creating performance tests.
- The validation will be the successful execution of the load tests and the collection of performance data.
- A baseline performance test should be run to establish the initial performance characteristics of the platform.
