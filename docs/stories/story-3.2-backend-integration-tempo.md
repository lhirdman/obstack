# Story 3.2: Backend Integration with Tempo

## Status
- Done

## Story
- **As a** Backend Developer,
- **I want** the backend to query a Tempo instance for trace data,
- **so that** we can securely serve distributed traces to the frontend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The backend provides a service that can connect to and query the Tempo API.
2.  All Tempo queries are secured by tenant context.
3.  A new API endpoint is created (e.g., `/api/v1/traces/{trace_id}`) that retrieves a specific trace from Tempo.
4.  The endpoint is protected and requires a valid JWT.
5.  The new endpoint is documented in the API reference (Redocly).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Develop a backend service to connect and query the Tempo API. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Ensure all Tempo queries are secured by tenant context. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Create the `/api/v1/traces/{trace_id}` endpoint to retrieve a specific trace. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Secure the new endpoint, requiring a valid JWT. (AC: #4)
- [x] Task 5: Document the new endpoint in the Redocly API reference. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- The new Tempo service should be located in `apps/backend/app/services/tempo_service.py`.
- Use a standard HTTP client like `httpx` to query the Tempo API.
- Tenant isolation for traces is critical. The `tenant_id` from the JWT must be used to ensure that the trace being queried belongs to the correct tenant. This may involve checking tags on the trace data itself.
- The Tempo API endpoint URL should be configurable via environment variables.

### Testing
- Create integration tests for the `/api/v1/traces/{trace_id}` endpoint.
- The tests should mock the Tempo API.
- Test scenarios:
    - A valid trace ID returns the correct trace data.
    - A user from Tenant A is denied access when requesting a trace belonging to Tenant B.
    - An invalid trace ID returns a 404 error.

### Status
- Ready for Review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is of high quality. The code is well-structured, follows a clean service-based architecture, and makes good use of FastAPI's features. Tenant isolation, a critical security requirement, is implemented correctly at both the data validation and query levels. The code is well-documented and includes a comprehensive test suite.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was necessary.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [✓] All required functionality is implemented and tested.

### Security Review
The implementation correctly handles authentication with JWT and enforces tenant isolation for all Tempo queries. No security issues were found.

### Performance Considerations
The use of an async HTTP client (`httpx`) is appropriate for a high-performance service. No performance issues were found.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/3.2-backend-integration-tempo.yml
