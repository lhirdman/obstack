# Story 2.2: Session Management and Protected Routes

## Status
- Done

## Story
- **As a** logged-in user,
- **I want** the application to keep me logged in and protect sensitive areas,
- **so that** I have a secure and seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The frontend securely stores the received JWT (e.g., in a secure, HttpOnly cookie).
2.  The JWT is automatically sent in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
3.  The backend includes middleware that validates the JWT on protected endpoints and rejects requests with invalid or missing tokens.
4.  The frontend implements "protected route" logic, redirecting unauthenticated users from dashboards back to the login page.
5.  A "Logout" button is available that clears the JWT and redirects to the login page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement secure JWT storage on the frontend (HttpOnly cookie). (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Ensure the JWT is sent automatically in API request headers. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Develop backend middleware to validate JWTs on protected endpoints. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Implement frontend protected route logic to redirect unauthenticated users. (AC: #4)
- [x] Task 5: Create a logout button that clears the session and redirects. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story builds on **Story 2.1**.
- **Backend:** The JWT validation middleware should be added to the FastAPI application in `apps/backend/app/core/security.py`. It should decode the token using the shared secret and check for expiration.
- **Frontend:**
    - For secure JWT storage, the backend should set an `HttpOnly` cookie upon login. The frontend will not need to store the token manually in local storage.
    - Protected routes can be implemented using a wrapper component that checks for the user's authentication status (e.g., by calling a `/users/me` endpoint).
    - The logout button should call a backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/logout`) that clears the `HttpOnly` cookie.

### Testing
- **Backend:**
    - Write integration tests for the JWT middleware. Test scenarios should include requests with a valid token, an invalid/expired token, and no token.
- **Frontend:**
    - Write component tests to verify that a user is redirected from a protected route if they are not authenticated.
    - Test the logout functionality to ensure the user is redirected to the login page.

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4)

### Debug Log References
- Implemented HttpOnly cookie authentication system
- Created JWT middleware for backend validation
- Built protected route components for frontend
- Added comprehensive test coverage

### Completion Notes
- **Backend Changes:**
  - Modified `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint to set HttpOnly cookies
  - Added `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint to clear cookies
  - Created `app/core/security.py` with JWT middleware
  - Updated `get_current_user` dependency to support both cookies and headers
  - Added comprehensive tests in `tests/test_security_middleware.py`

- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Created `lib/api-client.ts` for automatic credential inclusion
  - Created `services/auth.ts` for authentication service layer
  - Updated `LoginForm.tsx` to use new auth service
  - Created `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component for route protection
  - Created `Navbar.tsx` with logout functionality
  - Updated `App.tsx` to use protected route pattern
  - Created `Dashboard.tsx` as protected content
  - Added comprehensive tests for all new components

- **Security Features:**
  - JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies (secure from XSS)
  - Automatic credential inclusion in all API requests
  - Cookie takes priority over Authorization header
  - Proper logout that clears server-side cookie
  - Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users

### Review Date: 2025-08-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of session management and protected routes is of high quality. The backend correctly uses HttpOnly cookies for secure JWT storage, and the frontend leverages React Query effectively for state management. The code is well-structured, and the separation of concerns between components and services is clear. The test coverage is comprehensive for both frontend and backend.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
  - **Change**: Modified the `loginMutation`'s `onSuccess` handler to use `queryClient.invalidateQueries` instead of relying on a prop-drilled callback.
  - **Why**: To create a more idiomatic and robust data-fetching pattern with React Query, removing the need for the `authRefetchTrigger` state in `App.tsx`.
  - **How**: Injected `useQueryClient` and called `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['auth', 'me'] })` upon successful login.

- **File**: `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed the `authRefetchTrigger` state and associated handler functions (`handleLoginSuccess`, `handleLogout`).
  - **Why**: The component now automatically updates when the `['auth', 'me']` query is invalidated, simplifying the component's state management.
  - **How**: Removed the `useState` hook and the `onLoginSuccess` and `onLogout` props from child components.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored frontend auth flow to use `queryClient.invalidateQueries` for better state management.
- [x] Fixed broken unit tests after refactoring.

### Security Review
The security of this implementation is strong. The use of HttpOnly cookies is a significant defense against XSS attacks. The backend validation is robust. No security issues were found.

### Performance Considerations
No performance issues were identified. The use of `staleTime` in React Query on the frontend will prevent unnecessary API calls.

### Files Modified During Review
- `apps/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `apps/frontend/src/components/auth/AuthPage.tsx`
