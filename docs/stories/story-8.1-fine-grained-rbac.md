# Story 8.1: Fine-Grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As an** enterprise administrator,
- **I want** to create custom roles with specific, fine-grained permissions,
- **so that** I can enforce the principle of least privilege across my organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The backend is enhanced to support custom role definitions stored in the PostgreSQL database, linked to a tenant.
2.  The API authorization logic is updated to check for specific permissions (e.g., `logs:read`, `costs:write`) rather than just broad roles.
3.  The Admin view in the frontend is updated with a UI for creating, editing, and assigning these custom roles.
4.  Permissions are enforced at both the API gateway and the backend service layer.
5.  This feature is protected by an `[Enterprise]` feature flag and documented in the Docusaurus admin guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Enhance the backend to support custom role definitions in PostgreSQL. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Update API authorization logic to check for specific permissions. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Create a UI in the Admin view for managing custom roles. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Enforce permissions at the API gateway and backend service layer. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Protect the feature with an `[Enterprise]` feature flag and document it. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- **[Enterprise]** This is an enterprise-level feature.
- New database tables will be required for `roles`, `permissions`, and `role_permissions`. This will require an Alembic migration.
- The JWT payload should be updated to include a list of fine-grained permissions for the user.
- The API gateway (Kong) can be configured to inspect the JWT and enforce permissions at the edge for some routes.
- The backend's dependency injection system should be used to create a dependency that checks for the required permissions on each endpoint.

### Testing
- This feature requires extensive testing.
- Backend tests to verify that users can only perform actions for which they have the correct permissions.
- Test all levels of access (e.g., read-only, write, admin).
- E2E tests to cover the UI for role creation and assignment.
- Security testing to ensure that there are no bypasses to the permission system.
