# Story 1.2: Documentation Site Setup

## Status
- Ready for Review

## Story
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** a Docusaurus site to be initialized and deployed,
- **so that** we have a live platform for project documentation from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A Docusaurus instance is set up in a `docs/` package within the monorepo.
2.  The site is configured with a basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture).
3.  A CI/CD workflow is created to automatically deploy the Docusaurus site (e.g., to GitHub Pages or Vercel) on every merge to `main`.
4.  The live documentation site includes a placeholder "Architecture Overview" page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Set up Docusaurus instance in the `docs/` package. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Configure the site with the basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture). (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Create a CI/CD workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Add a placeholder "Architecture Overview" page to the live site. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story depends on the completion of **Story 1.1**, which sets up the monorepo structure.
- The Docusaurus instance should be set up in the `docs/` package at the monorepo root. Key configuration files to modify will be `docusaurus.config.ts` and `sidebars.ts`.
- Use Docusaurus v3.6+.
- The CI/CD workflow for deployment will be implemented using GitHub Actions and will deploy to **GitHub Pages**.
- The workflow must handle build failures gracefully and report errors in the CI logs.
- **Secrets:** The GitHub Actions workflow will require a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: read` and `pages: write` permissions. This is typically available by default.
- The basic structure should include sections for User Guide, API Reference, and Architecture.
- The placeholder "Architecture Overview" page should be a simple Markdown file.
- All code and configuration must adhere to the standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.

### Testing
- Testing for the documentation site will primarily involve CI checks to ensure the Docusaurus site builds successfully without errors.
- Verify that the deployed site is accessible and the basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture) is present.
- Ensure the placeholder "Architecture Overview" page is rendered correctly.
- No complex unit or integration tests are expected for the Docusaurus site itself, as its primary function is content rendering.


## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-08-19 | 1.1 | Expanded and validated story, added details. | Bob (SM) |
| 2025-08-19 | 1.0 | Initial draft created from Epic 1. | Sarah (PO) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

### Implementation Summary
All tasks completed successfully. The Docusaurus documentation site is now fully configured with CI/CD deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Docusaurus Instance**: Already set up in docs/ package with v3.6.0
2. **Site Structure**: Verified comprehensive structure with User Guide, API Reference, Architecture, Deployment, and Troubleshooting sections
3. **CI/CD Workflow**: Created `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` for automatic GitHub Pages deployment
4. **Architecture Overview**: Comprehensive architecture page already exists with detailed system overview, diagrams, and technical specifications

### File List
- `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` (created)
- `docs/docusaurus.config.ts` (updated - fixed GitHub URLs and baseUrl for proper deployment)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (updated - added documentation build job)

### Configuration Updates
- Updated GitHub repository URLs to match actual repo (lhirdman/obstack)
- Set proper baseUrl for GitHub Pages deployment (/observastack/)
- Fixed organizationName and projectName for GitHub Pages
- Removed invalid exclude property from Docusaurus config
- Added documentation build verification to CI pipeline

### Completion Notes
- All acceptance criteria met
- Docusaurus site properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- CI/CD pipeline includes both build verification and automatic deployment
- Architecture overview page contains comprehensive technical documentation
- Site structure includes all required sections: User Guide, API Reference, Architecture

### Debug Log References
- Fixed TypeScript error in docusaurus.config.ts by removing invalid exclude property
- Updated repository URLs to match actual GitHub repository
