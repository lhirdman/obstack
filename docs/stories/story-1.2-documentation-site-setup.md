# Story 1.2: Documentation Site Setup

## Status
- Ready

## Story
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** a Docusaurus site to be initialized and deployed,
- **so that** we have a live platform for project documentation from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A Docusaurus instance is set up in a `docs/` package within the monorepo.
2.  The site is configured with a basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture).
3.  A CI/CD workflow is created to automatically deploy the Docusaurus site (e.g., to GitHub Pages or Vercel) on every merge to `main`.
4.  The live documentation site includes a placeholder "Architecture Overview" page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up Docusaurus instance in the `docs/` package. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Configure the site with the basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture). (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Create a CI/CD workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages or Vercel. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Add a placeholder "Architecture Overview" page to the live site. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story depends on the completion of **Story 1.1**, which sets up the monorepo structure.
- The Docusaurus instance should be set up in the `docs/` package at the monorepo root. Key configuration files to modify will be `docusaurus.config.ts` and `sidebars.ts`.
- Use Docusaurus v3.6+.
- The CI/CD workflow for deployment will be implemented using GitHub Actions and will deploy to **GitHub Pages**.
- The workflow must handle build failures gracefully and report errors in the CI logs.
- **Secrets:** The GitHub Actions workflow will require a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: read` and `pages: write` permissions. This is typically available by default.
- The basic structure should include sections for User Guide, API Reference, and Architecture.
- The placeholder "Architecture Overview" page should be a simple Markdown file.
- All code and configuration must adhere to the standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.

### Testing
- Testing for the documentation site will primarily involve CI checks to ensure the Docusaurus site builds successfully without errors.
- Verify that the deployed site is accessible and the basic structure (User Guide, API Reference, Architecture) is present.
- Ensure the placeholder "Architecture Overview" page is rendered correctly.
- No complex unit or integration tests are expected for the Docusaurus site itself, as its primary function is content rendering.
