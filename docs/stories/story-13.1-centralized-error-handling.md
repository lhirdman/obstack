# Story 13.1: `[Community]` Implement Centralized Error Handling Middleware

**As a** Backend Developer,
**I want** to implement a centralized error handling middleware in FastAPI,
**so that** we can standardize error responses, reduce code duplication, and improve maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new FastAPI middleware is created that intercepts all unhandled exceptions.
2.  The middleware correctly logs the exception details for debugging purposes.
3.  The middleware returns a standardized JSON error response to the client (e.g., `{"detail": "Internal Server Error"}`) with a `500` status code for unexpected errors.
4.  The middleware handles custom application exceptions and maps them to appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
5.  Existing API endpoints are refactored to remove repetitive `try...except` blocks and rely on the new middleware.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
-   This story is a direct result of a recommendation from the QA review of **Story 3.1**. The goal is to improve the backend architecture based on that feedback.

### System Architecture
-   This is a horizontal architectural improvement that will affect all API endpoints.
-   The new middleware should be one of the first to be registered in the FastAPI application to ensure it catches exceptions from all subsequent layers.
-   [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

### File Locations
-   The new middleware can be created in a new file, e.g., `apps/backend/app/core/error_handling.py`.
-   The middleware will need to be registered in `apps/backend/app/main.py`.
-   The primary files to be refactored are the existing API endpoints, such as `apps/backend/app/api/v1/metrics.py`.

### Testing Requirements
-   **Unit Tests**: The middleware logic itself should be unit tested to ensure it correctly handles different types of exceptions.
-   **Integration Tests**: Existing integration tests for the API endpoints should be updated to verify that they now return the standardized error responses from the middleware when an error is triggered.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)** **Create Error Handling Middleware**
    *   Create the `error_handling.py` file.
    *   Implement the FastAPI middleware function.
    *   Add logic to log exceptions.
    *   Implement the logic to return a standardized JSON response for different exception types.

2.  **Integrate Middleware**
    *   Register the new middleware in the `apps/backend/app/main.py` file.

3.  **(AC: 5)** **Refactor Existing Endpoints**
    *   Go through all existing API endpoint files (e.g., `metrics.py`, `auth.py`).
    *   Remove the repetitive `try...except` blocks that catch generic exceptions.
    *   Ensure that the endpoints still correctly handle specific, expected exceptions where necessary.

4.  **Update Tests**
    *   Write unit tests for the new middleware.
    *   Update existing integration tests to assert that the correct standardized error format is returned when an error is induced.
