# Story 13.1: `[Community]` Implement Centralized Error Handling Middleware

**As a** Backend Developer,
**I want** to implement a centralized error handling middleware in FastAPI,
**so that** we can standardize error responses, reduce code duplication, and improve maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new FastAPI middleware is created that intercepts all unhandled exceptions.
2.  The middleware correctly logs the exception details for debugging purposes.
3.  The middleware returns a standardized JSON error response to the client (e.g., `{"detail": "Internal Server Error"}`) with a `500` status code for unexpected errors.
4.  The middleware handles custom application exceptions and maps them to appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
5.  Existing API endpoints are refactored to remove repetitive `try...except` blocks and rely on the new middleware.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
-   This story is a direct result of a recommendation from the QA review of **Story 3.1**. The goal is to improve the backend architecture based on that feedback.

### System Architecture
-   This is a horizontal architectural improvement that will affect all API endpoints.
-   The new middleware should be one of the first to be registered in the FastAPI application to ensure it catches exceptions from all subsequent layers.
-   [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

### File Locations
-   The new middleware can be created in a new file, e.g., `apps/backend/app/core/error_handling.py`.
-   The middleware will need to be registered in `apps/backend/app/main.py`.
-   The primary files to be refactored are the existing API endpoints, such as `apps/backend/app/api/v1/metrics.py`.

### Testing Requirements
-   **Unit Tests**: The middleware logic itself should be unit tested to ensure it correctly handles different types of exceptions.
-   **Integration Tests**: Existing integration tests for the API endpoints should be updated to verify that they now return the standardized error responses from the middleware when an error is triggered.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)** **Create Error Handling Middleware** ✅
    *   Create the `error_handling.py` file.
    *   Implement the FastAPI middleware function.
    *   Add logic to log exceptions.
    *   Implement the logic to return a standardized JSON response for different exception types.

2.  **Integrate Middleware** ✅
    *   Register the new middleware in the `apps/backend/app/main.py` file.

3.  **(AC: 5)** **Refactor Existing Endpoints** ✅
    *   Go through all existing API endpoint files (e.g., `metrics.py`, `auth.py`).
    *   Remove the repetitive `try...except` blocks that catch generic exceptions.
    *   Ensure that the endpoints still correctly handle specific, expected exceptions where necessary.

4.  **Update Tests** ✅
    *   Write unit tests for the new middleware.
    *   Update existing integration tests to assert that the correct standardized error format is returned when an error is induced.

### Agent Model Used
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

### Debug Log References
- All tasks completed successfully
- Comprehensive error handling middleware implemented
- Existing endpoints refactored to remove repetitive error handling
- Full test coverage for middleware and updated API behavior
- QA fixes applied: Security vulnerability resolved, test failures fixed

### Completion Notes List
1. **Task 1 Complete**: Created comprehensive error handling middleware in `apps/backend/app/core/error_handling.py` with:
   - Custom exception classes for different error types (CustomValidationError, AuthenticationError, etc.)
   - Centralized middleware that intercepts all unhandled exceptions
   - Proper logging with request context (path, method, client, traceback)
   - Standardized JSON error responses with consistent format
2. **Task 2 Complete**: Integrated middleware into main FastAPI application with proper registration order
3. **Task 3 Complete**: Refactored existing endpoints:
   - Removed repetitive try-catch blocks from metrics API endpoints
   - Updated metrics service to use custom ExternalServiceError instead of HTTPException
   - Maintained specific exception handling where needed (HTTPException passthrough)
4. **Task 4 Complete**: Comprehensive test coverage:
   - Unit tests for all custom exception classes
   - Integration tests for middleware behavior with different exception types
   - Updated existing metrics API tests to verify new error handling behavior
   - Tests for proper logging and request context capture
5. **QA Fixes Applied**:
   - **Security Fix**: Replaced complex regex-based tenant label injection with safer approach using vector matching
   - **Reliability Fix**: Fixed ValidationError naming conflict by renaming to CustomValidationError
   - **Test Fixes**: Updated all tests to work with new secure tenant label injection and fixed naming conflicts
   - **Input Validation**: Added proper tenant_id validation to prevent injection attacks
