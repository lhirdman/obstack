# Story 2.4: Keycloak Login Flow Frontend

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As an** Enterprise user,
- **I want** to be redirected to my company's login page (via Keycloak) to authenticate,
- **so that** I can use my standard corporate credentials to access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  When `AUTH_METHOD` is set to `keycloak`, the frontend login page redirects the user to the Keycloak login screen.
2.  After successful authentication with Keycloak, the user is redirected back to the application.
3.  The frontend correctly receives and stores the JWT issued by Keycloak.
4.  The user is successfully logged in and can access protected routes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: When `AUTH_METHOD` is `keycloak`, redirect the user from the login page to the Keycloak login screen. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Handle the redirect back from Keycloak after successful authentication. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Correctly receive and store the JWT issued by Keycloak. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Ensure the user is logged in and can access protected routes post-authentication. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **[Enterprise]** This is an enterprise-level feature.
- The frontend will need a configuration service to read the `AUTH_METHOD` and the Keycloak instance details (URL, realm, client ID).
- Use a library like `keycloak-js` or a generic OIDC client library to handle the redirect-based login flow.
- The redirect URI will need to be configured and allowed in the Keycloak client settings.
- Upon successful redirect, the library will handle parsing the token from the URL fragment.

### Testing
- E2E tests using **Playwright** are essential for this story.
- The E2E test will need to:
    - Navigate to the login page.
    - Verify the redirect to the Keycloak login page.
    - Programmatically log in to Keycloak (this may require a separate test user in the Keycloak container).
    - Verify the redirect back to the application.
    - Confirm that the user is logged in and can access a protected route.

## Dev Agent Record
*This section is for the development agent.*

### Agent Model Used
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented Keycloak authentication integration for the frontend application. The implementation supports both local and Keycloak authentication methods based on the `AUTH_METHOD` environment variable.

### Key Components Implemented

#### Configuration Service (`apps/frontend/src/lib/config.ts`)
- Centralized configuration management for authentication settings
- Reads environment variables for Keycloak configuration (URL, realm, client ID)
- Supports dynamic switching between local and Keycloak authentication

#### Keycloak Service (`apps/frontend/src/services/keycloak.ts`)
- Complete Keycloak integration using `keycloak-js` library
- Handles initialization, login redirect, logout, and user profile management
- Implements token management and silent SSO checks
- Provides JWT token access for API calls

#### Enhanced Auth Service (`apps/frontend/src/services/auth.ts`)
- Updated to support both local and Keycloak authentication methods
- Unified interface for authentication operations
- Automatic method detection based on configuration
- JWT token integration for API requests

#### Updated Components
- **LoginForm**: Conditionally renders Keycloak SSO button or local login form
- **AuthPage**: Hides registration option for Keycloak authentication
- **App**: Added routing support for Keycloak callback handling
- **KeycloakCallback**: Dedicated component for handling authentication callbacks

#### API Client Enhancement (`apps/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- Automatic JWT token inclusion for Keycloak authentication
- Maintains backward compatibility with cookie-based local authentication

- `apps/frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` - Environment variable type definitions
- `apps/frontend/public/silent-check-sso.html` - Silent SSO check page

#### Modified Files
- `apps/frontend/src/services/auth.ts` - Enhanced for dual authentication support
- `apps/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Keycloak UI integration
- `apps/frontend/src/components/auth/AuthPage.tsx` - Conditional registration form
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added routing and callback handling
- `apps/frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` - JWT token support

### Environment Variables Required
```
VITE_AUTH_METHOD=keycloak
VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8080
VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=observastack
VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=observastack-frontend
```

### Testing Implementation
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for Keycloak service and auth service
- **Component Tests**: LoginForm component testing for both authentication modes
- **E2E Tests**: Complete Keycloak authentication flow testing with Playwright

### Debug Log References
- All tasks completed successfully without blocking issues
- Keycloak integration follows OIDC standards
- JWT tokens properly handled and included in API requests
- Silent SSO check implemented for seamless user experience

### Status

## QA Results
*This section is for the QA agent.*

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the Keycloak authentication flow is of high quality. The code is well-structured, follows good design patterns (Facade/Adapter for `AuthService`), and is easily maintainable. The use of the standard `keycloak-js` library is appropriate and secure. The testing strategy is comprehensive, with a good mix of unit, component, and E2E tests that cover the acceptance criteria and edge cases.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code is clean and well-written.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✗] Could not be verified as `docs/coding-standards.md` was not found.
- Project Structure: [✗] Could not be verified as `docs/unified-project-structure.md` was not found.
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Could not be verified as `docs/testing-strategy.md` was not found.
- All ACs Met: [✓] All acceptance criteria are met.

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Create the following standards documents: `docs/coding-standards.md`, `docs/unified-project-structure.md`, `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

### Security Review

The implementation is secure. It correctly uses the `keycloak-js` library for the OIDC flow and sends the JWT as a Bearer token in API requests. No security vulnerabilities were identified.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues were identified. The use of `check-sso` and silent token refresh are good for user experience.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
