# Story 6.3: Frontend UI for Alert Management

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** site reliability engineer,
- **I want** to view and manage all of my alerts in a centralized dashboard,
- **so that** I can track and respond to incidents efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Alerts" view is created in the frontend application.
2.  The UI displays a list of all active alerts, showing severity, source, title, and timestamp.
3.  The UI allows users to filter alerts by status, severity, or other labels.
4.  Users can click on an alert to see a detailed view with all its metadata.
5.  From the detail view, users with appropriate permissions can change the alert's status (e.g., Acknowledge, Resolve).
6.  The Alerts view is documented in the Docusaurus user guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create the new "Alerts" view in the frontend. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Display a list of active alerts with key information. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement filtering by status, severity, and labels. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Create a detailed view for individual alerts. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Implement the ability to change alert status from the detail view. (AC: #5)
- [ ] Task 6: Document the new Alerts view in the Docusaurus user guide. (AC: #6)

## Dev Notes
- The new "Alerts" view should be a new page component in `apps/frontend/src/pages/AlertsPage.tsx`.
- Use a table component to display the list of alerts.
- The filtering UI should update the API query parameters and refetch the data using **TanStack Query**.
- The detailed view could be a modal or a separate page.

### Testing
- Component tests for the alerts list, filtering UI, and the detailed alert view.
- E2E tests to cover the user flow of:
    - Viewing the list of alerts.
    - Filtering the alerts by status.
    - Clicking an alert to open the detail view.
    - Changing the status of an alert.
