# Story 9.2: Synthetic Data Generation Service

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** QA engineer,
- **I want** a service that can generate realistic, multi-tenant logs, metrics, and traces,
- **so that** I can populate the test environment with high-quality test data on demand.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Synthetic Data Generator" service is created.
2.  The service provides an API endpoint to trigger data generation for a specific tenant and data type.
3.  The generated data is realistic enough to test the functionality of the search and visualization features.
4.  The service can generate data that simulates common error conditions and anomalies.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create the new "Synthetic Data Generator" service. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Implement an API endpoint to trigger data generation. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure the generated data is realistic enough for testing search and visualization. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Implement the ability to generate data simulating error conditions and anomalies. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- The Synthetic Data Generator can be a simple Python application with a FastAPI interface.
- Use libraries like `faker` to generate realistic-looking data.
- The service should be able to generate data for all three signal types: logs (Loki), metrics (Prometheus), and traces (Tempo).
- The API should allow specifying the volume and characteristics of the data to be generated.

### Testing
- Unit tests for the data generation logic for each signal type.
- Integration tests for the API endpoint.
- E2E tests that trigger data generation and then verify that the data appears correctly in the Obstack UI.
