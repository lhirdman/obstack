# Story 6.4: Advanced Alert Notifications

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** Pro plan customer,
- **I want** to configure Obstack to send alert notifications to external systems like Slack or PagerDuty,
- **so that** my team can be notified of issues through our existing on-call workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The Admin view is updated to include a "Notification Channels" configuration page.
2.  The backend provides a service to securely store and manage webhook URLs and API keys for external services.
3.  When a new, high-severity alert is ingested, the backend triggers a notification to all configured channels for that tenant.
4.  This feature is protected by a `[SaaS]` feature flag.
5.  The setup process is documented in the Docusaurus user guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add a "Notification Channels" configuration page to the Admin view. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Develop a backend service to securely manage webhook URLs and API keys. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement the logic to trigger notifications on new, high-severity alerts. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Protect the feature with a `[SaaS]` feature flag. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Document the notification channel setup process in Docusaurus. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- **[SaaS]** This is a SaaS/Pro plan feature.
- Secure storage of secrets is critical. Use a secure vault solution or encrypt the secrets in the database.
- The notification service should be a background task managed by **Celery** to avoid blocking the API request.
- The feature flag logic should be implemented in both the frontend (to show/hide the UI) and the backend (to protect the API endpoints).

### Testing
- Integration tests for the notification service.
- Mock the external services (Slack, PagerDuty) to verify that the correct payloads are sent.
- E2E tests to cover the UI flow of creating and managing notification channels.
- Tests to verify that the feature is correctly hidden/disabled when the feature flag is off.
