# Story 10.3: Test Dashboard and Reporting

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** QA engineer,
- **I want** a dashboard where I can view the results of all automated tests over time,
- **so that** I can track the overall quality and reliability of the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Test Dashboard" service is created (this could be a set of Grafana dashboards or a custom UI).
2.  The dashboard queries the Test Results Database to display historical trends for E2E, load, and other tests.
3.  The dashboard visualizes key metrics like test pass/fail rates, performance regressions, and test suite duration.
4.  The system can automatically generate and email a daily or weekly quality report.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create a new "Test Dashboard" service. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Query the Test Results Database to display historical test trends. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Visualize key metrics like pass/fail rates and performance regressions. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Implement automatic generation and emailing of quality reports. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- Using **Grafana** is the recommended approach for the test dashboard. New dashboards can be provisioned as code.
- The Grafana instance will need a data source configured to connect to the Test Results Database (PostgreSQL).
- The email reporting functionality can be implemented using a scheduled **Celery** task that queries the database, generates a report (e.g., as a PDF or HTML), and sends it via an email service.

### Testing
- The primary validation for this story is the successful creation and population of the test dashboard.
- E2E tests should verify that the dashboard loads and displays data from the Test Results Database.
- Integration tests for the email reporting service to ensure that reports are generated and sent correctly.
