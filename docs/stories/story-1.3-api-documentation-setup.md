# Story 1.3: API Documentation Setup

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** the FastAPI backend to be configured to serve auto-generated OpenAPI documentation using Redocly,
- **so that** our API documentation is always in sync with the code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The FastAPI application is configured to generate an OpenAPI spec from the code.
2.  The application serves a visually appealing and user-friendly API doc using Redocly at the `/api/docs` endpoint.
3.  A basic "health check" endpoint (`/api/v1/health`) is created and appears in the Redocly documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Configure FastAPI to generate an OpenAPI spec from the code. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Serve API documentation using Redocly at the `/api/docs` endpoint. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Create a `/api/v1/health` endpoint and ensure it appears in the documentation. (AC: #3)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story depends on the completion of **Story 1.1**, which sets up the backend application.
- The FastAPI application's `main.py` file should be modified to include the necessary configurations for generating the OpenAPI spec.
- According to the `tech-stack.md`, we will use **Redocly** to render the OpenAPI spec. The endpoint should be `/api/docs`.
- The health check endpoint should be located at `apps/backend/app/api/v1/health.py` as per the `source-tree.md` structure.
- The endpoint should return a simple JSON response: `{"status": "ok"}`.
- All new Python code must adhere to the `snake_case` naming convention and other standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.

### Testing
- A unit test is required for the `/api/v1/health` endpoint.
- The test should be created in the `apps/backend/app/api/v1/` directory, likely named `test_health.py`.
- The test will use **Pytest** and an HTTP client (like `httpx`) to make a request to the endpoint and assert that the response status code is 200 and the body matches `{"status": "ok"}`.
- Refer to the `Testing` section in `coding-standards.md` for general testing principles.
