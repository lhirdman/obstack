# Story 1.3: API Documentation Setup

## Status
- Done

## Story
- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** the FastAPI backend to be configured to serve auto-generated OpenAPI documentation using Redocly,
- **so that** our API documentation is always in sync with the code.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The FastAPI application is configured to generate an OpenAPI spec from the code.
2.  The application serves a visually appealing and user-friendly API doc using Redocly at the `/api/docs` endpoint.
3.  A basic "health check" endpoint (`/api/v1/health`) is created and appears in the Redocly documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Configure FastAPI to generate an OpenAPI spec from the code. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Serve API documentation using Redocly at the `/api/docs` endpoint. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Create a `/api/v1/health` endpoint and ensure it appears in the documentation. (AC: #3)

## Dev Notes
- **Dependency:** This story depends on the completion of **Story 1.1**, which sets up the backend application.
- The FastAPI application's `main.py` file should be modified to include the necessary configurations for generating the OpenAPI spec.
- According to the `tech-stack.md`, we will use **Redocly** to render the OpenAPI spec. The endpoint should be `/api/docs`.
- The health check endpoint should be located at `apps/backend/app/api/v1/health.py` as per the `source-tree.md` structure.
- The endpoint should return a simple JSON response: `{"status": "ok"}`.
- All new Python code must adhere to the `snake_case` naming convention and other standards defined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.

### Testing
- A unit test is required for the `/api/v1/health` endpoint.
- The test should be created in the `apps/backend/app/api/v1/` directory, likely named `test_health.py`.
- The test will use **Pytest** and an HTTP client (like `httpx`) to make a request to the endpoint and assert that the response status code is 200 and the body matches `{"status": "ok"}`.
- Refer to the `Testing` section in `coding-standards.md` for general testing principles.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

### Implementation Summary
All tasks completed successfully. FastAPI backend now serves auto-generated OpenAPI documentation using Redocly with a functional health check endpoint.

### Tasks Completed
1. **FastAPI OpenAPI Configuration**: Updated main.py with proper OpenAPI settings including title, description, version, and custom OpenAPI URL
2. **Redocly Documentation**: Configured custom `/api/docs` endpoint serving Redocly-rendered API documentation
3. **API Structure**: Created proper API directory structure following source-tree.md specifications
4. **Health Endpoint**: Implemented `/api/v1/health` endpoint with Pydantic response model and proper documentation
5. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive tests for the health endpoint using FastAPI TestClient

### File List
- `apps/backend/app/main.py` (updated - added OpenAPI config, Redocly endpoint, health router)
- `apps/backend/app/api/__init__.py` (created)
- `apps/backend/app/api/v1/__init__.py` (created)
- `apps/backend/app/api/v1/health.py` (created - health endpoint with Pydantic model)
- `apps/backend/app/api/v1/test_health.py` (created - unit tests for health endpoint)

### Implementation Details
- **OpenAPI Configuration**: FastAPI app configured with proper metadata and custom OpenAPI JSON endpoint
- **Redocly Integration**: Custom HTML endpoint serving Redocly documentation at `/api/docs`
- **API Versioning**: Proper v1 API structure with router-based organization
- **Response Models**: Pydantic models for type safety and automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests covering both functionality and response model validation

### Completion Notes
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code follows snake_case naming conventions per coding standards
- Proper API structure implemented per source-tree.md
- Health endpoint returns {"status": "ok"} as specified
- Documentation automatically generated and accessible at /api/docs
- Unit tests provide full coverage of health endpoint functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows the project's coding standards. The use of Pydantic models for the response is a good practice, and the API documentation setup is correct.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was necessary. The code is of high quality.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Resolved test execution issue by running tests from the correct directory with the appropriate `PYTHONPATH`.

### Security Review
No security concerns were found. The health check endpoint is a public, read-only endpoint with no sensitive information.

### Performance Considerations
No performance issues were found. The endpoint is lightweight and should respond quickly.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status
Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-api-documentation-setup.yml

### Recommended Status
✓ Ready for Done
