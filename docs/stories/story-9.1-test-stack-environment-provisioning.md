# Story 9.1: Test Stack Environment Provisioning

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As a** platform developer,
- **I want** the test environment, including the full Obstack application and core test services, to be deployable via a single command,
- **so that** I can easily spin up a complete, isolated environment for validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A `docker-compose.test.yml` (or similar) is created that deploys the entire Obstack stack (frontend, backend, Loki, etc.).
2.  The Compose file also deploys new services for the test stack: a Test Runner, a Test Results Database (PostgreSQL), and a Health Monitor.
3.  All services are configured to run in a dedicated, isolated Docker network.
4.  The deployment process is documented in the developer guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create a `docker-compose.test.yml` to deploy the full Obstack stack. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Add the Test Runner, Test Results Database, and Health Monitor services to the Compose file. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Configure all services to run in a dedicated, isolated Docker network. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Document the test environment deployment process in the developer guide. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- The `docker-compose.test.yml` should extend the main `docker-compose.yml` to avoid duplication.
- The **Test Runner** service will be a container that can execute the E2E and integration test suites.
- The **Test Results Database** will be a separate PostgreSQL instance for storing test outcomes.
- The **Health Monitor** service will be a simple application that periodically checks the health of all other services in the test stack.

### Testing
- The primary test for this story is the successful deployment of the test environment.
- A CI job should be created that runs `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d` and verifies that all containers start successfully.
- A simple health check test should be run to confirm that the Health Monitor service can reach all other services.
