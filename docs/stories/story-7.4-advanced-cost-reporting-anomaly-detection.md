# Story 7.4: Advanced Cost Reporting and Anomaly Detection

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As an** Enterprise customer,
- **I want** to generate chargeback/showback reports and be alerted to cost anomalies,
- **so that** I can perform internal cost accounting and proactively manage unexpected spend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The backend includes a service that can generate detailed cost allocation reports suitable for chargeback.
2.  A new API endpoint is created for generating and downloading these reports (e.g., as CSV).
3.  The backend includes a scheduled job that analyzes cost data for significant, anomalous spikes.
4.  When an anomaly is detected, a high-severity alert is created and sent to the Alert Management system.
5.  The UI is updated to include a "Reporting" section and an "Anomalies" view.
6.  This feature is protected by an `[Enterprise]` feature flag and documented in the Docusaurus site.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Develop a backend service to generate detailed cost allocation reports. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Create an API endpoint for generating and downloading reports. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Implement a scheduled job to analyze cost data for anomalies. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Create and send a high-severity alert when an anomaly is detected. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Task 5: Update the UI with "Reporting" and "Anomalies" sections. (AC: #5)
- [ ] Task 6: Protect the feature with an `[Enterprise]` feature flag and document it. (AC: #6)

## Dev Notes
- **[Enterprise]** This is an enterprise-level feature.
- The reporting service should be able to generate reports in CSV format.
- The anomaly detection job should be a **Celery** task that runs on a schedule (e.g., daily).
- The anomaly detection logic could use statistical methods like standard deviation or moving averages to identify spikes.
- The new UI sections should be protected by the `[Enterprise]` feature flag.

### Testing
- Backend tests for the report generation logic.
- Tests for the anomaly detection algorithm with sample data.
- E2E tests for the report downloading functionality and the new UI views.
- Tests to verify that the feature is correctly hidden/disabled when the feature flag is off.
