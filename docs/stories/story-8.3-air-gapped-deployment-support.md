# Story 8.3: Air-Gapped Deployment Support

## Status
- Approved

## Story
- **As an** enterprise administrator in a secure environment,
- **I want** the Ansible playbooks to support a fully air-gapped deployment,
- **so that** I can run the platform in a network with no internet access.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  All container images required for the platform are documented and can be pre-loaded into a private registry.
2.  The Ansible playbooks are updated to be configurable to pull images from a private registry instead of the public internet.
3.  All features, including cost calculations (using custom pricing models), function correctly without external network calls.
4.  A detailed guide for performing an air-gapped installation is added to the Docusaurus documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Document all required container images for pre-loading. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Task 2: Update Ansible playbooks to be configurable for a private registry. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Task 3: Ensure all features function correctly without internet access. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Task 4: Create a detailed guide for air-gapped installation in Docusaurus. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
- **[Enterprise]** This is an enterprise-level feature.
- The list of container images should be provided in a simple, machine-readable format (e.g., a text file with one image per line).
- The Ansible playbooks should use a variable to define the image registry, which can be overridden by the user.
- For cost calculations, the system will need a way to ingest custom pricing data for an air-gapped environment. This may require a new API endpoint and UI for uploading pricing information.

### Testing
- This feature is difficult to test in a standard CI/CD pipeline.
- A dedicated test environment that simulates an air-gapped network will be required.
- The test process will involve:
    1. Pre-loading all images into a private registry.
    2. Running the Ansible playbooks with the private registry configuration.
    3. Verifying that the platform deploys and functions correctly without any internet access.
