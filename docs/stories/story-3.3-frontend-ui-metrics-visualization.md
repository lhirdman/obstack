# Story 3.3: Frontend UI for Metrics Visualization

## Status
- Done

## Story
- **As a** DevOps engineer,
- **I want** to visualize metrics from my services in the Obstack UI,
- **so that** I can monitor the health and performance of my applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new "Metrics" view is created in the frontend application.
2.  The UI includes a query builder or raw PromQL input field that sends requests to the backend's metrics endpoint.
3.  The UI uses a charting library (e.g., embedding Grafana panels or using a library like Apache ECharts) to render the time-series data returned by the API.
4.  The view includes the global time-range selector.
5.  A user guide for the Metrics view is added to the Docusaurus site.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create the new "Metrics" view in the frontend application. (AC: #1)
- [x] Task 2: Implement a query builder/input field for sending requests to the backend. (AC: #2)
- [x] Task 3: Integrate a charting library to render time-series data. (AC: #3)
- [x] Task 4: Ensure the global time-range selector is included in the view. (AC: #4)
- [x] Task 5: Add a user guide for the new Metrics view to the Docusaurus site. (AC: #5)

## Dev Notes
- The new "Metrics" view should be a new page component in `apps/frontend/src/pages/MetricsPage.tsx`.
- Use **TanStack Query** to fetch data from the `/api/v1/metrics/query` endpoint.
- For the charting library, **Apache ECharts** is the recommended choice as per the architecture. Create a reusable chart component.
- The global time-range selector should be a shared component that can be used across different views.

### Testing
- Create component tests for the new Metrics view using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Mock the backend API to test the chart rendering with sample time-series data.
- E2E tests using **Playwright** should cover the user flow of entering a query, executing it, and seeing a chart render on the page.

### **QA Review Report: Story 3.3 - Frontend UI for Metrics Visualization**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Review Date** | 2025-08-23 |
| **Reviewed By** | Quinn (Test Architect) |
| **Story** | `docs/stories/story-3.3-frontend-ui-metrics-visualization.md` |
| **Gate Status** | **PASS** |
| **Recommended Status** | **[✔ Approved]** |

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

The story has passed the quality gate. The developer successfully remediated all previously identified bugs, and the Vitest suite of 114 unit and component tests now passes completely. The core functionality is stable and well-tested at the unit level.

### **2. Test Execution Results**

*   **Unit/Component Tests**: **PASS**
    *   **Result**: All 114 tests passed.
    *   **Notes**: The final fix to the heroicons mock in `test-setup.ts` resolved the last remaining failure.
*   **E2E Tests**: **WAIVED**
    *   **Result**: The E2E test suite was not executed during this review.
    *   **Reason**: Waived at the explicit request of the user to avoid potential hanging issues with the test runner. The stability of the unit tests provides high confidence in the component's functionality.

### **3. Conclusion**

After several iterations, the story now meets the required quality standards. The code is stable, the unit test suite is robust, and all acceptance criteria have been met. The story is approved and ready to be moved to the next stage.
