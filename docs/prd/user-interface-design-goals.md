# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user interface for Obstack should feel like a single, cohesive, and modern application, abstracting away the complexity of the multiple open-source tools running in the background. The user experience must be fast, intuitive, and data-dense, enabling engineers to correlate information and find insights quickly. The design should prioritize clarity and efficiency over flashy visuals, establishing trust through a professional and reliable interface.

## Primary User Journeys

To ensure the design meets the core goals, the following user journeys will be prioritized.

### Journey 1: Troubleshooting a Production Incident

This is the most critical workflow and represents the core value proposition of the platform.

    A[Receives Alert via Slack] --> B{Login to Obstack};
    B --> C[View Alert in Alert Dashboard];
    C --> D{Examine Alert Details & Labels};
    D --> E[Pivot to Metrics Dashboard];
    E --> F{Identify Anomalous Metric (e.g., high latency)};
    F --> G[Pivot to Related Traces];
    G --> H{Find Slow Trace Span};
    H --> I[Pivot to Logs for that Trace];
    I --> J{Discover Error Log Message};
    J --> K[Identify Root Cause];
```

## Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Unified Navigation:** A persistent primary navigation structure will be present at all times, allowing users to seamlessly switch between Logs, Metrics, Traces, Alerts, and Cost views without losing context.
*   **Cross-Signal Linking:** A core interaction will be the ability to "pivot" from one signal to another. For example, a user viewing a specific trace should be able to click a button to see all logs associated with that trace ID within the same time range.
*   **Contextual Time Range:** A global time-range selector will control the data displayed across all views, but each panel or view should also allow for local overrides to compare different time windows.
*   **Embedded Dashboards:** Grafana dashboards will be seamlessly embedded within the application shell, with consistent theming and branding to avoid a jarring user experience.

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Login Screen:** A clean, simple interface for authentication (handles both Local and SSO).
*   **Main Dashboard / Overview:** A high-level summary view showing system health, active alerts, and a cost overview.
*   **Unified Search View:** The primary interface for querying logs, metrics, and traces.
*   **Alerting View:** A dedicated screen for viewing, filtering, and managing the status of alerts.
*   **Cost Insights View:** A dashboard focused on visualizing Kubernetes cost data from OpenCost, including breakdowns and trends.
*   **Admin View:** An area for managing tenants, users, roles, and system settings.

## Accessibility

The application will target **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes considerations for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

## Branding

The UI will use a modern, clean "dark mode" aesthetic, common in developer tools. It will establish a unique but minimal Obstack brand identity while ensuring that data visualizations (e.g., in Grafana) are clear and legible.

## Target Device and Platforms

The primary target is **Web Responsive**. The application must be fully functional on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). While not mobile-first, the layout should be usable on tablets for on-call engineers.
