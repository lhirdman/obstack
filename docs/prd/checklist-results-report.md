# Checklist Results Report

*(This section was populated by the Product Manager agent on 2025-08-19 after running the `pm-checklist`.)*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

*   **Overall PRD Completeness:** **95% (Excellent)**
*   **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** **Just Right**
*   **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** **Ready**
*   **Most Critical Gaps:** The previously blocking issues have been successfully resolved. The PRD now contains measurable success metrics and specific, testable non-functional requirements. The remaining gaps are minor and can be addressed concurrently with the architecture phase.

## 2. Category Analysis Table

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | **PASS** | None. The addition of KPIs and Market Context provides a solid foundation. |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | **PASS** | None. The "Out of Scope" section provides excellent clarity and focus. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | **PASS** | None. The primary user journey is well-documented and provides a clear narrative for the core workflow. |
| 4. Functional Requirements | **PASS** | None. This section remains a key strength. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | **PASS** | None. The new table format with specific, measurable targets is exactly what the architect needs. |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | **PASS** | None. The epics and stories are logical and well-defined. |
| 7. Technical Guidance | **PASS** | None. The new "Known Risks & Complexities" section effectively flags areas for architectural focus. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | **PARTIAL**| Minor gap: Data volume and retention requirements could be more specific (e.g., "store up to 1TB of logs"). This can be refined during architecture. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | **PASS** | None. The addition of the stakeholder section and the user journey diagram has significantly improved clarity. |

## 3. Top Issues by Priority

*   **BLOCKERS:** **None.**
*   **HIGH PRIORITY:** **None.**
*   **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
    1.  **Refine Data Requirements:** During the architecture phase, work with the architect to define more specific targets for data volume, query performance at scale, and data retention policies for different tiers.
*   **LOW PRIORITY:**
    1.  **Add More User Journeys:** While the primary incident response journey is excellent, adding journeys for "Onboarding a New User" or "Exploring Costs for the First Time" would be beneficial for the UX team later.

## 4. Recommendations

1.  **Proceed to Architecture:** The PRD is now robust, clear, and actionable. It is ready to be handed off to the `@architect` agent to begin the system design phase.
2.  **Collaborate on Data Requirements:** The PM should work with the architect to refine the data volume and retention requirements as the data models are being designed.

This PRD is in excellent shape. The clarity provided by the recent additions will significantly accelerate the next phases of the project.
