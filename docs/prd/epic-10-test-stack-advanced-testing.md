# Epic 10: The Test Stack - Advanced Testing (Load & Chaos)

**Epic Goal:** To implement advanced testing capabilities, including load testing and chaos engineering, to validate the performance, scalability, and resilience of the Obstack platform under production-like stress.

## Stories for Epic 10

### Story 10.1: `[SaaS]` Load Testing Service for API and Data Ingestion
*   **As a** site reliability engineer,
*   **I want** a service that can generate significant load against the platform's APIs and data ingestion endpoints,
*   **so that** I can understand its performance characteristics and identify bottlenecks.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A load testing engine (e.g., k6, Locust) is added to the test stack.
    2.  Test scripts are created to simulate realistic API usage patterns for multiple tenants.
    3.  Test scripts are created to simulate high-volume data ingestion for logs, metrics, and traces.
    4.  The load tests are configurable and can be triggered on demand.
    5.  Performance results (response times, error rates, throughput) are collected and stored in the Test Results Database.

### Story 10.2: `[Enterprise]` Chaos Engineering Service for Resilience Testing
*   **As a** platform operator,
*   **I want** a service that can inject controlled failures into the test environment,
*   **so that** I can validate the platform's resilience and recovery mechanisms.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A chaos engineering tool (e.g., Chaos Mesh or a custom script) is integrated into the test stack.
    2.  Chaos "experiments" are created to simulate common failure scenarios (e.g., a database container failing, network latency between services, a pod being deleted).
    3.  The Health Monitor service is used to observe the platform's reaction to the failure.
    4.  The test passes if the platform remains functional (in a degraded state if necessary) and recovers gracefully once the failure condition is removed.

### Story 10.3: `[SaaS]` Test Dashboard and Reporting
*   **As a** QA engineer,
*   **I want** a dashboard where I can view the results of all automated tests over time,
*   **so that** I can track the overall quality and reliability of the platform.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new "Test Dashboard" service is created (this could be a set of Grafana dashboards or a custom UI).
    2.  The dashboard queries the Test Results Database to display historical trends for E2E, load, and other tests.
    3.  The dashboard visualizes key metrics like test pass/fail rates, performance regressions, and test suite duration.
    4.  The system can automatically generate and email a daily or weekly quality report.
