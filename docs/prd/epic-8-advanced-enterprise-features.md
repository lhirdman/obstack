# Epic 8: Advanced Enterprise Features

**Epic Goal:** To implement the remaining high-value, enterprise-grade features, primarily focused on advanced security, compliance, and administrative control. This epic delivers the core functionality that distinguishes the Enterprise tier.

## Stories for Epic 8

**Story 8.1: `[Enterprise]` Fine-Grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
*   **As an** enterprise administrator,
*   **I want** to create custom roles with specific, fine-grained permissions,
*   **so that** I can enforce the principle of least privilege across my organization.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The backend is enhanced to support custom role definitions stored in the PostgreSQL database, linked to a tenant.
    2.  The API authorization logic is updated to check for specific permissions (e.g., `logs:read`, `costs:write`) rather than just broad roles.
    3.  The Admin view in the frontend is updated with a UI for creating, editing, and assigning these custom roles.
    4.  Permissions are enforced at both the API gateway and the backend service layer.
    5.  This feature is protected by an `[Enterprise]` feature flag and documented in the Docusaurus admin guide.

**Story 8.2: `[Enterprise]` Detailed Audit Logging**
*   **As a** compliance officer,
*   **I want** to view a detailed, immutable audit log of all significant user and system actions,
*   **so that** I can meet our regulatory and security audit requirements.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new `audit_logs` table is created in the PostgreSQL database.
    2.  The backend includes a logging service that records key events (e.g., login, resource creation/deletion, permission change) to this table.
    3.  The audit log includes the user, timestamp, action, and relevant metadata.
    4.  A new API endpoint is created for querying the audit log with filters for user and date range.
    5.  A new "Audit Log" view is added to the Admin section of the UI.
    6.  This feature is protected by an `[Enterprise]` feature flag.

**Story 8.3: `[Enterprise]` Air-Gapped Deployment Support**
*   **As an** enterprise administrator in a secure environment,
*   **I want** the Ansible playbooks to support a fully air-gapped deployment,
*   **so that** I can run the platform in a network with no internet access.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  All container images required for the platform are documented and can be pre-loaded into a private registry.
    2.  The Ansible playbooks are updated to be configurable to pull images from a private registry instead of the public internet.
    3.  All features, including cost calculations (using custom pricing models), function correctly without external network calls.
    4.  A detailed guide for performing an air-gapped installation is added to the Docusaurus documentation.
    5.  This capability is a key deliverable of the Enterprise plan.
