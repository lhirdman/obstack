# Epic 9: The Test Stack - Core Infrastructure & E2E Testing

**Epic Goal:** To build the foundational parallel test environment and implement the first suite of automated end-to-end (E2E) tests. This epic delivers the infrastructure necessary to validate the quality and functionality of the core Obstack platform.

## Stories for Epic 9

**Story 9.1: `[SaaS]` Test Stack Environment Provisioning**
*   **As a** platform developer,
*   **I want** the test environment, including the full Obstack application and core test services, to be deployable via a single command,
*   **so that** I can easily spin up a complete, isolated environment for validation.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A `docker-compose.test.yml` (or similar) is created that deploys the entire Obstack stack (frontend, backend, Loki, etc.).
    2.  The Compose file also deploys new services for the test stack: a Test Runner, a Test Results Database (PostgreSQL), and a Health Monitor.
    3.  All services are configured to run in a dedicated, isolated Docker network.
    4.  The deployment process is documented in the developer guide.

**Story 9.2: `[SaaS]` Synthetic Data Generation Service**
*   **As a** QA engineer,
*   **I want** a service that can generate realistic, multi-tenant logs, metrics, and traces,
*   **so that** I can populate the test environment with high-quality test data on demand.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A new "Synthetic Data Generator" service is created.
    2.  The service provides an API endpoint to trigger data generation for a specific tenant and data type.
    3.  The generated data is realistic enough to test the functionality of the search and visualization features.
    4.  The service can generate data that simulates common error conditions and anomalies.

**Story 9.3: `[SaaS]` E2E Test Suite for Authentication and Core UI**
*   **As a** platform developer,
*   **I want** an automated E2E test suite that validates the core authentication and UI navigation,
*   **so that** I can ensure these critical user workflows never break.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  An E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) is added to the monorepo.
    2.  The test runner is configured to execute E2E tests against the deployed test stack.
    3.  Tests are created for: Local user registration, Local user login, Keycloak user login, and navigation between the main views (Logs, Metrics, etc.).
    4.  The E2E tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and run automatically.

**Story 9.4: `[SaaS]` E2E Test Suite for Multi-Tenant Isolation**
*   **As a** security engineer,
*   **I want** an automated E2E test that proves a user from one tenant cannot access data from another,
*   **so that** I can be confident in our core security model.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The test suite uses the Synthetic Data Generator to create data for at least two separate tenants (Tenant A and Tenant B).
    2.  An E2E test logs in as a user from Tenant A.
    3.  The test attempts to query for data belonging to Tenant B via the UI and API.
    4.  The test passes if and only if all attempts to access Tenant B's data are correctly denied.
    5.  This test is a blocking requirement for any production release.
