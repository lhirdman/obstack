# Obstack Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   **Unified Experience:** Provide a single, seamless web interface for logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and Kubernetes cost monitoring.
*   **Tiered Open-Core Model:** Deliver the platform via a clear, three-tiered strategy: a self-hostable, open-source **Community** tier; a managed, multi-tenant **SaaS** tier; and a fully isolated, single-tenant **Enterprise** tier.
*   **Value-Driven Monetization:** Reserve advanced, high-value features such as SSO/SAML authentication, detailed cost optimization reporting, and advanced security features for the paid SaaS and Enterprise tiers.
*   **Production-Grade Reliability:** Ensure the platform is highly reliable through a comprehensive, parallel test stack capable of sophisticated automated testing, including load, chaos, and security validation.
*   **Control Plane Driven Automation:** Manage all customer lifecycle operations (provisioning, billing, tier management) for the paid offerings through a dedicated, external **Control Plane**.
*   **Frictionless Community Adoption:** Provide a complete, self-hostable Community edition with local user authentication to foster open-source adoption and community contribution.

### Background Context

Modern software operations require a complex suite of observability tools, often forcing teams to juggle disconnected platforms and pay exorbitant licensing fees. Obstack addresses this by unifying best-in-class open-source tools into a single, cohesive platform.

The project follows an **Open Core** business model, supported by a hybrid technical architecture. The core product is an open-source, self-hostable **Community edition** offering powerful observability fundamentals. Monetization is achieved through two commercial tiers: a managed **SaaS tier** and a high-security **Enterprise tier**, both of which unlock advanced features. This tiered strategy is managed by a separate, proprietary **Control Plane** that handles all business logic, cleanly separating the commercial aspects from the open-source core product. This PRD defines the requirements for the core `obstack/platform` repository, which will contain the functionality for all three tiers, managed via a feature flagging system.

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

The observability market is dominated by large, proprietary SaaS platforms (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) that offer powerful but expensive solutions. While the open-source world provides best-in-class tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki), integrating and managing them at scale is a significant engineering challenge.

Obstack's strategic opportunity is to bridge this gap, offering a "best of both worlds" solution: the power of the open-source stack in a unified, easy-to-use product. Our primary competitor in this space is Grafana Labs, which follows a similar open-core model. Our key differentiator will be a more seamless, out-of-the-box user experience with a stronger focus on cross-signal correlation and cost management.

### Success Metrics & KPIs

To ensure the project is aligned with its goals, the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be tracked.

| Tier | Metric | KPI Target (First 6 Months) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Requirements

### Scope Boundaries & Out of Scope

To maintain focus on the core MVP, the following areas are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial epics:

*   **Log Management:** No log archiving, rehydration, or complex log-based metric creation.
*   **Metrics:** No support for ingesting metrics from proprietary agents. The focus is on Prometheus compatibility.
*   **Traces:** No advanced trace analytics or automatic anomaly detection on trace patterns.
*   **Custom Dashboards:** The initial version will rely on embedded Grafana for complex dashboards; a native dashboard builder is out of scope.
*   **User Management:** No support for teams or fine-grained resource access within a tenant. Initial roles are limited to Admin and Viewer.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user interface for Obstack should feel like a single, cohesive, and modern application, abstracting away the complexity of the multiple open-source tools running in the background. The user experience must be fast, intuitive, and data-dense, enabling engineers to correlate information and find insights quickly. The design should prioritize clarity and efficiency over flashy visuals, establishing trust through a professional and reliable interface.

### Primary User Journeys

To ensure the design meets the core goals, the following user journeys will be prioritized.

#### Journey 1: Troubleshooting a Production Incident

This is the most critical workflow and represents the core value proposition of the platform.

```mermaid

    A[Receives Alert via Slack] --> B{Login to Obstack};
    B --> C[View Alert in Alert Dashboard];
    C --> D{Examine Alert Details & Labels};
    D --> E[Pivot to Metrics Dashboard];

    G --> H{Find Slow Trace Span};
    H --> I[Pivot to Logs for that Trace];
    I --> J{Discover Error Log Message};
    J --> K[Identify Root Cause];
```

### Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Unified Navigation:** A persistent primary navigation structure will be present at all times, allowing users to seamlessly switch between Logs, Metrics, Traces, Alerts, and Cost views without losing context.
*   **Cross-Signal Linking:** A core interaction will be the ability to "pivot" from one signal to another. For example, a user viewing a specific trace should be able to click a button to see all logs associated with that trace ID within the same time range.
*   **Contextual Time Range:** A global time-range selector will control the data displayed across all views, but each panel or view should also allow for local overrides to compare different time windows.
*   **Embedded Dashboards:** Grafana dashboards will be seamlessly embedded within the application shell, with consistent theming and branding to avoid a jarring user experience.

### Core Screens and Views

*   **Login Screen:** A clean, simple interface for authentication (handles both Local and SSO).
*   **Main Dashboard / Overview:** A high-level summary view showing system health, active alerts, and a cost overview.
*   **Unified Search View:** The primary interface for querying logs, metrics, and traces.
*   **Alerting View:** A dedicated screen for viewing, filtering, and managing the status of alerts.
*   **Cost Insights View:** A dashboard focused on visualizing Kubernetes cost data from OpenCost, including breakdowns and trends.
*   **Admin View:** An area for managing tenants, users, roles, and system settings.

### Accessibility

The application will target **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes considerations for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Branding

The UI will use a modern, clean "dark mode" aesthetic, common in developer tools. It will establish a unique but minimal Obstack brand identity while ensuring that data visualizations (e.g., in Grafana) are clear and legible.

### Target Device and Platforms

The primary target is **Web Responsive**. The application must be fully functional on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). While not mobile-first, the layout should be usable on tablets for on-call engineers.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

The project will be developed in two separate repositories to support the Open Core model:
1.  **`obstack/platform` (Monorepo):** This open-source repository will contain the core product, including the `frontend`, `backend`, `ansible`, and `docs` packages. It is designed for tight integration between the full-stack components.
2.  **`obstack/control-plane` (Separate Repo):** This proprietary repository will contain the commercial business logic, including the landing page, user sign-up, subscription management, billing integration, and the administrative dashboard for managing SaaS/Enterprise customer instances.

This PRD pertains exclusively to the `obstack/platform` repository.

### Service Architecture

The platform will be built using a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** architecture. A central FastAPI backend will serve as an orchestration and security layer, providing a unified API for the frontend while communicating with the various underlying open-source observability services (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, OpenCost, etc.).

A **PostgreSQL** database will be included in the architecture to store data for both the open-source and commercial tiers, including local user accounts, tenant-specific settings, and future SaaS-related data like support tickets.

### Pluggable Authentication

The authentication system will be designed to be pluggable to support the tiered business model.
*   **Community Tier:** Will use a built-in **Local Authentication** provider that stores user credentials securely in the PostgreSQL database.
*   **SaaS/Enterprise Tiers:** Will use a **Keycloak Authentication** provider, enabling SSO/OIDC and SAML/LDAP integrations.

The selection of the authentication provider will be managed via configuration (e.g., environment variables).

### Feature Flagging System

To manage the feature differences between the Community, SaaS, and Enterprise tiers within a single codebase, a **feature flagging / entitlement system** will be implemented. The backend will check a user's subscription tier (stored in the PostgreSQL database) and dynamically enable or disable features via a set of flags that are passed to both the backend and frontend.

### Known Risks & Complexities

*   **Unified Search Performance:** The unified search service (Epic 5) is a potential performance bottleneck, as it needs to query multiple data sources in parallel and aggregate the results. This requires careful architectural design to ensure low latency.
*   **Data Correlation Logic:** The logic for seamlessly correlating signals (e.g., finding the exact logs for a specific trace) can be complex. This feature is high-value but also high-risk in terms of implementation.
*   **Test Data Realism:** The success of the parallel Test Stack (Epics 9 & 10) depends heavily on the ability of the Synthetic Data Generator to produce realistic, multi-tenant workloads.

### Stakeholders & Communication

*   **Primary Stakeholder:** The user (`lohi`).
*   **Core Team:** The BMad AI Agent team (`pm`, `architect`, `sm`, `dev`, etc.).
*   **Communication:** As the team is small and co-located in this environment, formal communication plans are not required. All project artifacts, including this PRD and the subsequent architecture documents, will serve as the primary source of truth.

### Testing Requirements

The platform's quality and reliability will be ensured by a comprehensive, parallel **Test Stack**. This separate environment will mirror the production stack and will be capable of automated end-to-end testing, synthetic data generation, load testing, chaos engineering, and security scanning. The Test Stack is a core component of the project, ensuring production-readiness for all tiers.
