# Observastack Brownfield Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the Observastack codebase, including technical debt, workarounds, and real-world patterns. It serves as a reference for AI agents working on enhancements.

### Document Scope

Comprehensive documentation of the entire system, with a focus on the alignment between the existing code and the project's PRD and architecture documents.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |

| 2025-08-20 | 1.0 | Initial brownfield analysis | BMad Master |

## Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

### Critical Files for Understanding the System

- **Frontend Entry**: `apps/frontend/src/main.tsx`
- **Backend Entry**: `apps/backend/app/main.py`
- **Configuration**: `.env.example` files in both frontend and backend
- **Core Business Logic**: `apps/backend/app/services/`
- **API Definitions**: `apps/backend/app/api/`
- **Database Models**: `apps/backend/app/models/`

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The project is a monorepo managed with Nx, containing a React/Vite frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend. This aligns with the intended architecture. The project is in its early stages, with the basic structure in place but limited functionality implemented.

### Actual Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Node.js (frontend), Python (backend) | As per `.nvmrc` and `Dockerfile` | |
| Framework | React (Vite), FastAPI | Latest versions | |
| Database | PostgreSQL | As per `docker-compose.yml` | |
| Monorepo | Nx | ^21.4.0 | |

### Repository Structure Reality Check

- Type: Monorepo
- Package Manager: npm
- Notable: The project is well-structured, with separate `apps` and `packages` directories, as recommended by the architecture.

## Source Tree and Module Organization

### Project Structure (Actual)

```text
observastack/

│   ├── frontend/
│   └── backend/
├── packages/
│   └── shared-types/
├── docs/
├── docker/

```

### Key Modules and Their Purpose

- **Frontend**: `apps/frontend` - The user-facing React application.
- **Backend**: `apps/backend` - The FastAPI backend that serves the frontend and interacts with the database and other services.
- **Shared Types**: `packages/shared-types` - TypeScript types shared between the frontend and backend.

## Data Models and APIs

### Data Models

- **Database Models**: Defined in `apps/backend/app/models/`.
- **Shared Types**: Defined in `packages/shared-types/`.

### API Specifications

- **API Endpoints**: Defined in `apps/backend/app/api/`.

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

- The project is in its early stages, so there is minimal technical debt.
- The `test` script in the root `package.json` is a placeholder and needs to be implemented.

## Integration Points and External Dependencies

- The frontend and backend are integrated via a REST API.
- The backend is integrated with a PostgreSQL database.

## Development and Deployment

### Local Development Setup

- The project can be run locally using Docker Compose.

### Build and Deployment Process

- The project is containerized using Docker.

## Testing Reality

### Current Test Coverage

- The testing infrastructure is in place, but there are no tests yet.

## Enhancement Impact Analysis

- The current codebase provides a solid foundation for implementing the features outlined in the PRD.
- The immediate next steps should be to implement the authentication and core service integration epics.
