# Dependency Management Strategy

This document outlines the policies and procedures for managing external dependencies within the Obstack project to ensure security, stability, and maintainability.

## 1. Versioning Strategy

-   **Pinning Exact Versions**: All external dependencies in package management files (`package.json`, `poetry.lock`) **must** be pinned to exact versions. Version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3`, `~1.2.3`) are not permitted.
    -   **Rationale**: This ensures that every build is reproducible and prevents unexpected breaking changes from transitive dependencies.

## 2. Update & Patching Strategy

-   **Regular Reviews**: A review of all external dependencies will be conducted on a **quarterly basis** to identify and apply updates.
-   **Security Vulnerability Scanning**:
    -   Automated security vulnerability scanning (e.g., `npm audit`, `snyk`) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    -   Any **critical** or **high** severity vulnerabilities that are discovered must be addressed within **48 hours**.
-   **Updating Process**:
    1.  Create a new feature branch for the dependency updates.
    2.  Update the dependencies and run the full test suite (unit, integration, E2E) to ensure no regressions have been introduced.
    3.  Submit a Pull Request with the updates, which must be reviewed and approved before merging.

## 3. Licensing & Compliance

-   **License Compatibility**: Before adding any new dependency, its license must be verified to be compatible with the project's open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
-   **License Scanning**: Automated license scanning tools will be used to maintain a manifest of all third-party licenses and ensure compliance.

## 4. Fallback Approaches

For critical external services (e.g., third-party APIs), the architecture should be designed with resilience in mind.
-   **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers (e.g., using a library like `resilience4j` for Java, or a similar pattern in Python/TypeScript) for all critical external API calls.
-   **Caching**: Cache responses from external services where appropriate to reduce the impact of service unavailability.
