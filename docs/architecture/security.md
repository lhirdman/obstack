# Security Architecture

This document outlines the security principles and implementation strategies for the Obstack platform. All development and infrastructure decisions must adhere to these guidelines to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

## 1. Data Security

### 1.1. Encryption in Transit

All communication between services, both internal and external, **must** be encrypted using **TLS 1.2 or higher**. This includes:
-   User traffic from the browser to the frontend and API Gateway.
-   Communication between the API Gateway (Kong) and the backend (FastAPI).
-   Connections from the backend to the database (PostgreSQL), cache (Redis), and all other internal services.
-   Communication with any third-party APIs.

Self-signed certificates may be used for local development, but all staging and production environments must use valid, trusted certificates.

### 1.2. Encryption at Rest

All persistent data containing potentially sensitive information **must** be encrypted at rest.
-   **PostgreSQL Database**: The underlying storage for the RDS instance (or equivalent) must be encrypted.
-   **Object Storage (S3/MinIO)**: Server-side encryption (SSE) must be enabled for all buckets used for storing logs, metrics, and traces.
-   **Backups**: All database and storage backups must also be encrypted.

## 2. API & Service Security

### 2.1. Input Validation

All data received from external sources **must** be strictly validated.
-   The **FastAPI backend** will leverage **Pydantic models** for all incoming request bodies. This provides automatic, declarative validation for all API endpoints. Any request that fails validation will be rejected with a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response.

### 2.2. Rate Limiting & Throttling

To protect against abuse and ensure service stability, rate limiting will be implemented at the API Gateway (Kong).
-   **Default Rate Limit**: A sensible default rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP) will be applied to all authenticated endpoints.
-   **Login Endpoints**: Stricter rate limits will be applied to authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/register`) to mitigate brute-force attacks.

## 3. Infrastructure Security

### 3.1. Network Security

The infrastructure will be designed with a defense-in-depth approach.
-   **VPC & Subnets**: The application will be deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Public subnets will be used for internet-facing resources like load balancers, while private subnets will be used for backend services and databases.
-   **Security Groups / Firewalls**: Network access control lists and security groups will be configured to restrict traffic between services to only what is explicitly required. The default policy will be to deny all traffic.

### 3.2. Principle of Least Privilege

All components of the system, from infrastructure roles to application service accounts, will operate with the minimum level of privilege necessary to perform their function.
-   **IAM Roles**: In cloud environments, IAM roles with narrowly scoped permissions will be used for all services.
-   **Database Users**: The backend application will connect to the database with a user that has the minimum required permissions (e.g., no superuser privileges).
