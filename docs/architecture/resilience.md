# Resilience & Operational Readiness

This document outlines the architectural strategies for ensuring the Obstack platform is resilient, observable, and operationally ready for production environments.

## 1. Error Handling & Resilience

The platform will be designed to be resilient to partial failures.

### 1.1. Backend Error Handling

-   **Global Exception Handler**: The FastAPI backend will implement a global exception handler to catch all unhandled exceptions and return a standardized JSON error response (e.g., `{"detail": "An internal server error occurred"}`) with a `500` status code, preventing stack trace leaks.
-   **Specific Exceptions**: For predictable errors (e.g., "not found," "permission denied"), specific exception handlers will return appropriate `4xx` status codes.

### 1.2. Inter-Service Communication

-   **Timeouts**: All network requests between services (e.g., backend to Loki, backend to database) **must** have aggressive timeouts configured (e.g., 2-5 seconds).
-   **Retries**: For idempotent operations, a simple retry mechanism (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff) will be implemented for transient network errors.
-   **Circuit Breakers**: For critical, high-volume calls to external services (e.g., the query service fanning out to Loki/Prometheus), a circuit breaker pattern will be implemented. If a downstream service is unresponsive, the circuit will "open" for a period, preventing the platform from being overwhelmed by failing requests.

## 2. Monitoring & Observability (Self-Monitoring)

The Obstack platform must be observable itself. We will use our own stack to monitor our own health.

-   **Logging**:
    -   All application components (frontend, backend) and infrastructure services will output structured logs (JSON).
    -   These logs will be collected by a dedicated Vector agent and forwarded to our own Loki instance for analysis.
-   **Metrics**:
    -   The FastAPI backend will expose a `/metrics` endpoint in the Prometheus exposition format.
    -   This endpoint will provide key application-level metrics (e.g., API request latency, error rates, database connection pool usage).
    -   A dedicated Prometheus instance will scrape this endpoint to monitor the health of the platform.
-   **Alerting**:
    -   Alerting rules will be defined in Prometheus (`rules.yml`) to fire on critical platform health indicators (e.g., high API error rate, high latency, low disk space).
    -   These alerts will be sent to Alertmanager for routing and notification.

## 3. Performance & Scaling

-   **Caching**:
    -   **Redis** will be used for caching frequently accessed, non-critical data. This includes user session information and cached query results from downstream services.
-   **Load Balancing**:
    -   In a scaled deployment, traffic to the backend and frontend services will be distributed via a load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx).
-   **Scaling Strategy**:
    -   The application is designed to be stateless where possible, allowing for **horizontal scaling**. Both the frontend and backend services can be scaled by adding more container instances.

## 4. Deployment & DevOps

-   **Deployment Strategy**:
    -   The recommended deployment strategy for production environments is **Blue-Green Deployment**. This involves deploying the new version of the application alongside the old version, allowing for instant, low-risk rollback by simply switching the traffic router.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    -   The pipeline, managed via GitHub Actions, will automate all steps from commit to deployment: linting, testing, building container images, and orchestrating the blue-green deployment via Ansible.
-   **Rollback Procedure**:
    -   In the event of a failed deployment, the rollback procedure is to switch the load balancer or API gateway back to the previous, stable "blue" environment. This is an instantaneous operation.
