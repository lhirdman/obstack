# ADR-002: Platform Expansion Strategy

**Date:** 2025-08-22

**Status:** Proposed

## Context

The Observastack platform currently provides a robust solution for [current core functionality, e.g., log aggregation and application performance monitoring]. To enhance our market position and provide a more comprehensive observability solution, we have identified several key areas for expansion. The goal is to add new, high-value capabilities that complement the existing feature set without requiring a complete re-architecture of the core platform.

## Decision

We will expand the Observastack platform by developing three new, distinct feature pillars:

1.  **Synthetic Monitoring:** To provide proactive, automated monitoring of application availability and performance from a global perspective. This includes uptime checks, multi-step API transaction tests, and full browser-based user journey simulations.

2.  **Security & Compliance Scanning:** To integrate capabilities that check for application vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. This will start with dependency scanning and proactive vulnerability scanning of customer systems via third-party API integrations.

3.  **Cloud Cost Management:** To provide insights into cloud resource utilization and spending. This will include unused resource detection, cost-saving recommendations, and budget alerting, primarily by integrating with major cloud provider APIs.

These pillars were chosen because they address common customer needs, align with the observability domain, and can be implemented in a phased approach.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

-   **Increased Product Value:** Significantly broadens the platform's capabilities, making it a more complete and attractive solution.
-   **New Revenue Streams:** Each new pillar has the potential to be a separate pricing dimension or add-on.
-   **Phased Implementation:** The three pillars are architecturally distinct and can be developed, tested, and released independently, allowing for incremental value delivery.

**Negative:**

-   **Increased Complexity:** The platform's domain and operational footprint will grow, requiring new expertise in security, cloud cost optimization, and distributed systems.
-   **New Dependencies:** The security and cost management pillars will rely on third-party and cloud provider APIs, introducing external dependencies that must be managed.
