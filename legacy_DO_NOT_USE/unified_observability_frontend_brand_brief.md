# Brand Brief: Unified Observability Frontend

## 1. Brand Name
**Working Name:** ObservaStack  
**Tagline:** *"All Your Signals. One View."*  
**Alternative Names:** SignalHub, OmniScope, InsightForge

---

## 2. Brand Purpose
**Mission:** To give IT teams, MSPs, and SaaS operators a unified, intuitive interface for collecting, storing, and visualizing logs, metrics, and traces—built entirely on open-source technologies.

**Vision:** To make enterprise-grade observability accessible to every organization, without the vendor lock-in and licensing costs of commercial APM tools.

## 3. Target Audience
**Primary Audience:**
- Medium to large IT departments.
- Managed Service Providers (MSPs).
- SaaS platform operators.
- DevOps/SRE teams in security-conscious industries.

**Secondary Audience:**
- Enterprises looking to replace expensive APM platforms like Instana/NewRelic/Splunk with OSS alternatives.
- Startups scaling microservices architectures.

**Customer Pain Points:**
- Fragmented tooling (separate dashboards for logs, metrics, traces).
- High licensing costs for commercial observability platforms.
- Slow alerting on dynamic anomalies (delta-based or predictive alerts).
- Poor cost optimization visibility for cloud/on-prem workloads.

---

## 4. Brand Personality
**Tone of Voice:** Professional but approachable, focused on empowering technical teams to achieve clarity and control.

**Brand Traits:**
- Transparent: Open-source under the hood.
- Reliable: Designed for high availability and scale.
- Insightful: Surfaces cost, anomalies, and business impact—not just raw data.

## 5. Core Values
- **Openness:** 100% OSS-based stack—no lock-in.
- **Efficiency:** Designed for resource-aware deployments.
- **Integration:** Works with existing pipelines and exporters.
- **Insight over Noise:** Emphasis on actionable signals, not just metrics.

## 6. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
**What We Offer:**  
A unified frontend that consolidates logs, metrics, and traces from multiple open-source backends (Loki, OpenSearch, Thanos, Tempo) into a single, customizable Grafana interface—with built-in anomaly detection, right-sizing analytics, and service maps.

**Why We’re Different:**
- Pre-integrated stack—ready in minutes via Docker/Ansible.
- Built-in cost optimization dashboards.
- Delta- and prediction-based alerts (Zabbix-style).
- Service dependency graphs from trace data.
- Open storage format—your data stays yours.

---

## 7. Key Features
- **Centralized UI:** One Grafana with datasources for logs, metrics, and traces.
- **Multi-tenant support:** Per-tenant isolation and dashboards.
- **Right-Sizing Recommendations:** P95-based resource tuning + cost savings estimates.
- **Delta & Predictive Alerts:** Disk growth anomalies, CPU spikes, service latency jumps.
- **Service Maps:** Visualize dependencies and bottlenecks from traces.
- **Business Metrics Integration:** Funnel and conversion overlays tied to performance data.
- **Flexible Storage:** MinIO-based object storage, cloud-ready.
- **Pluggable Agents:** Vector, Prometheus Agent, OTel Collector.

---

## 8. Visual Identity
**Logo:** Modern, minimal, with “signal wave” + “eye” or “stacked layers” motif.  
**Color Palette:**  
- Primary: Steel Blue (#4A6FA5) — trust & technology.  
- Secondary: Teal Green (#3BA99C) — growth & optimization.  
- Accent: Amber (#FFC857) — anomalies & alerts.  
- Neutral: Light Gray (#ECEFF1).  

**Typography:** Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto Mono for technical text).

---

## 9. Marketing Strategy
- **Content Marketing:** Guides on building OSS observability, cost optimization case studies, alerting patterns.
- **Community Engagement:** GitHub presence, Slack/Discord support, webinars.
- **Targeted Outreach:** Partner with MSPs, DevOps consultancies.
- **Freemium Model:** Free community edition; paid for enterprise auth, tenant mgmt, long-term retention.
- **Migration Campaigns:** Tools & docs for moving from Instana/NewRelic to ObservaStack.

---

## 10. Roadmap
**Phase 1 (0–6 months)**
- Release Docker Compose & Ansible deploys.
- Core dashboards + alerting packs (rightsizing, anomaly detection, service health).

**Phase 2 (6–12 months)**
- SaaS multi-tenant edition.
- Cost optimization module (OpenCost integration).
- Frontend plugin for RUM/conversion tracking.

**Phase 3 (12–24 months)**
- ML-based anomaly detection.
- Self-service tenant onboarding.
- Marketplace for dashboard packs.
