# Project Brief — Unified Observability Frontend

## 1. Project Name
**Working Name:** ObservaStack  
**Tagline:** *"All Your Signals. One View."*

## 2. Problem Statement
Modern DevOps and SRE teams face fragmented observability workflows — logs in one tool, metrics in another, traces in yet another, and alerts scattered across multiple systems. This fragmentation increases mean time to resolution (MTTR), reduces operational visibility, and complicates multi-tenant environments. Commercial APM solutions like Datadog, Instana, and New Relic provide unified views, but at high licensing costs and with vendor lock-in.

## 3. Proposed Solution
ObservaStack is a **custom multi-tenant unified web application** that integrates logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and insights into a single branded UI. It embeds and extends Grafana panels for visualization while providing:
- Consistent navigation and styling
- Cross-signal linking (trace → logs → metrics)
- Multi-tenant RBAC and branding
- Consolidated alert center
- Insights dashboard for cost optimization and anomaly summaries

## 4. Goals & Objectives
**Primary Goals:**
- Deliver MVP with unified UI shell, Logs/Metrics/Traces views, and Ansible deployment framework.
- Provide embedded dashboards with consistent UX and tenant isolation.
- Implement alert aggregation and insights view in Phase 2.
- Enable future enhancements like ML anomaly detection and closed-loop automation.

**Secondary Goals:**
- Reduce MTTR for operational issues.
- Lower total cost of ownership vs. commercial APM tools.
- Build a strong OSS community around the project.

## 5. Target Audience
- **Primary:** DevOps teams, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), Managed Service Providers (MSPs), SaaS platform operators.
- **Secondary:** Enterprises replacing expensive APM platforms, startups scaling microservices.

## 6. Scope
**In Scope (MVP):**
- Ansible deployment for full backend stack.
- Custom UI shell with navigation and RBAC.
- Logs view (Loki/OpenSearch), metrics view (Thanos/Prometheus), traces view (Tempo).
- Tenant isolation and branding.
- Docker Compose dev environment.

**Out of Scope (MVP):**
- SaaS hosting.
- AI-driven anomaly detection.
- Closed-loop resource optimization.

## 7. Deliverables
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: UI shell, Logs/Metrics/Traces views, Ansible deploy, Docker Compose test env.
- **Phase 2**: Alert center, insights dashboard, cost optimization integration.
- **Phase 3**: ML anomaly detection, automation, advanced analytics.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Deployment count and active users.
- Reduction in MTTR compared to baseline.
- Community contributions and adoption.
- Reported cost savings from rightsizing insights.

## 9. Constraints
- Performance limitations on dev hardware (NUCs) for initial testing.
- Maturity of OpenTelemetry instrumentation in customer environments.
- Integration complexity of multi-tenant security across embedded dashboards.

## 10. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** OSS component API changes may break embeds.  
  **Mitigation:** Version pinning and compatibility testing.
- **Risk:** Tenant data leakage in multi-tenant mode.  
  **Mitigation:** RBAC enforcement at both UI and datasource level.
- **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks at scale.  
  **Mitigation:** Early load testing and horizontal scaling strategy.

## 11. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner:** You (Founder, Infrastructure Consultant)
- **Frontend Lead:** UI shell, embeds, navigation.
- **Backend Lead:** API gateway, search, alert aggregation.
- **DevOps Lead:** Ansible deployment automation.
- **End Users:** DevOps, SREs, MSPs, SaaS operators.

## 12. Timeline
- **Month 0–1:** Ansible deployment framework, Docker Compose dev setup.
- **Month 2–3:** UI shell, Logs/Metrics/Traces views.
- **Month 4–6:** Alert center, insights view, cost optimization.
- **Month 6–12:** SaaS-ready, ML anomaly detection prototypes.

## 13. Budget Estimate
- Development: Internal + OSS contributions.
- Hosting: Minimal for dev/test (NUCs, home lab).
- Optional: Cloud hosting costs for SaaS pilot.
