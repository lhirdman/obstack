# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The observability test stack provides a comprehensive, fully functional testing environment that includes the complete ObservaStack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend) along with all supporting infrastructure and testing capabilities. This system complements the production observability stack by providing a dedicated test environment for end-to-end validation, automated testing, synthetic data generation, load testing, and chaos engineering.

The test stack deploys a complete, isolated instance of the ObservaStack platform with all components (frontend, backend, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Keycloak, etc.) in a test-specific configuration. This ensures comprehensive validation of the entire application stack, maintains data integrity across multi-tenant test scenarios, and provides a safe environment for destructive testing without impacting production systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want a complete, deployable test environment with the full ObservaStack application, so that I can validate the entire system end-to-end in an isolated environment before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the test stack THEN the system SHALL provision a complete ObservaStack instance including React frontend, FastAPI backend, and all infrastructure components
2. WHEN the test environment starts THEN all services SHALL be accessible through the same interfaces as production (web UI, APIs, Grafana dashboards)
3. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN the system SHALL validate complete user workflows from login through data visualization and alerting
4. IF any component fails to deploy or function THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure reports and prevent test execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want synthetic data generation for testing, so that I can validate the observability platform with realistic data patterns without exposing production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating test data THEN the system SHALL create realistic logs, metrics, and traces that simulate production workloads
2. WHEN creating multi-tenant test data THEN the system SHALL generate data for multiple tenants with proper isolation boundaries
3. WHEN simulating error conditions THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and anomalies to test alert management workflows
4. IF data generation is requested THEN the system SHALL support configurable data volumes and patterns for different test scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want load testing capabilities, so that I can validate the observability platform's performance under realistic traffic conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing load tests THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic user traffic patterns across all application endpoints
2. WHEN testing data ingestion THEN the system SHALL validate the platform can handle expected log, metric, and trace volumes
3. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL collect and report response times, throughput, and resource utilization metrics
4. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL fail the test and provide detailed performance analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want chaos engineering capabilities, so that I can validate the observability platform's resilience to infrastructure failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running chaos experiments THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic failure scenarios including service outages, network partitions, and resource exhaustion
2. WHEN failures are injected THEN the system SHALL monitor the platform's ability to maintain functionality and recover gracefully
3. WHEN testing disaster recovery THEN the system SHALL validate backup and restore procedures for all data stores
4. IF the platform fails to recover THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure analysis and recovery recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want contract testing for APIs, so that I can ensure API compatibility and prevent breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API contracts THEN the system SHALL validate all endpoints against OpenAPI specifications
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify JWT token handling and RBAC enforcement
3. WHEN testing data formats THEN the system SHALL validate request and response schemas for all API endpoints
4. IF contract violations are detected THEN the system SHALL fail the test and provide specific violation details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want security testing capabilities, so that I can validate the observability platform's security posture and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running security tests THEN the system SHALL perform vulnerability scanning of all container images and dependencies
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL validate secure token handling and session management
3. WHEN testing tenant isolation THEN the system SHALL verify that users cannot access data from other tenants
4. IF security vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL provide detailed security reports and remediation guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want automated deployment of the complete test environment, so that I can validate deployment procedures and ensure the full application stack works correctly in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the test environment THEN the system SHALL use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to deploy the complete ObservaStack application and infrastructure
2. WHEN validating deployments THEN the system SHALL verify all services (frontend, backend, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Keycloak) start correctly and pass health checks
3. WHEN testing configuration THEN the system SHALL validate environment-specific settings, secrets management, and inter-service communication
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs, rollback capabilities, and service dependency analysis

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the test environment to include the complete ObservaStack application stack, so that I can perform realistic user acceptance testing and validate all application features in a production-like environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the test environment THEN the system SHALL provide the complete React frontend with all views (Search, Alerts, Insights, Admin)
2. WHEN using the test application THEN all FastAPI backend endpoints SHALL be functional and respond with test data
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL include a configured Keycloak instance with test users and tenants
4. IF the application components are not fully functional THEN the system SHALL prevent test execution and provide deployment status information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want continuous monitoring of the test environment, so that I can track test execution metrics and identify trends in platform reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on test execution times, success rates, and failure patterns
2. WHEN monitoring test infrastructure THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization and performance of the test environment itself
3. WHEN analyzing test results THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards and reports showing test trends and platform health
4. IF test performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert on test execution issues and provide diagnostic information
