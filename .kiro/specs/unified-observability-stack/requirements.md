# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The unified observability stack aims to provide a comprehensive, multi-tenant observability platform that consolidates logs, metrics, traces, and alerts into a single web application. This platform serves as a cost-effective alternative to commercial APM solutions like Datadog and New Relic, targeting DevOps teams, SREs, MSPs, and enterprises seeking to replace expensive APM platforms.

The system leverages open source technologies including Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, OpenSearch, and OpenCost, wrapped in a custom React/TypeScript frontend with FastAPI backend, providing unified navigation and multi-tenant security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to access all observability signals (logs, metrics, traces, alerts) through a single unified interface, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues without switching between multiple tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a unified view with embedded Grafana panels for metrics, logs, and traces
2. WHEN a user navigates between different signal types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation and styling across all views
3. WHEN a user performs cross-signal linking (trace → logs → metrics) THEN the system SHALL automatically correlate and navigate between related data points
4. IF a user has appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL display all available observability signals for their tenant

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a managed service provider, I want multi-tenant isolation and RBAC controls, so that I can securely serve multiple clients from a single observability platform instance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them through Keycloak and enforce tenant-specific access controls
2. WHEN a user accesses data THEN the system SHALL only display information belonging to their assigned tenant(s)
3. WHEN an admin configures user permissions THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls at both UI and datasource levels
4. IF a user attempts to access unauthorized data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want to receive and manage alerts from multiple sources in a centralized location, so that I can respond quickly to incidents and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN alerts are generated from Prometheus, Loki, or other sources THEN the system SHALL aggregate them in a unified alerts view
2. WHEN a user views alerts THEN the system SHALL display alert severity, source, timestamp, and relevant context
3. WHEN a user acknowledges or resolves an alert THEN the system SHALL update the alert status and notify relevant stakeholders
4. IF alert conditions are met THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications through configured channels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want insights into resource usage and cost optimization opportunities, so that I can make informed decisions about infrastructure scaling and cost management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the insights dashboard THEN the system SHALL display resource utilization metrics and cost optimization recommendations powered by OpenCost integration
2. WHEN the system analyzes usage patterns THEN it SHALL identify opportunities for rightsizing and cost savings using OpenCost data
3. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and recommendations based on OpenCost monitoring
4. IF historical data is available THEN the system SHALL provide trend analysis and forecasting using OpenCost historical cost data
5. WHEN users view Kubernetes costs THEN the system SHALL display cost breakdowns by namespace, workload, and service using OpenCost metrics
6. IF cost anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert users and provide optimization recommendations through OpenCost integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search across logs, metrics, and traces using a unified search interface, so that I can quickly find relevant information during debugging sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL search across all available data sources (logs, metrics, traces)
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display them in a unified format with source identification
3. WHEN a user filters search results THEN the system SHALL apply filters across all data types consistently
4. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and alternative search strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy and configure the observability stack using automated tools, so that I can ensure consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying for development THEN the system SHALL provide Docker Compose configuration for local setup
2. WHEN deploying for production THEN the system SHALL provide Ansible playbooks for automated deployment
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN all components SHALL use environment-specific configuration templates
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the application to provide a responsive and intuitive user interface, so that users can efficiently navigate and interact with observability data across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN a user navigates the application THEN the interface SHALL provide consistent navigation patterns and visual feedback
3. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and handle errors gracefully
4. IF the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login and preserve their intended destination

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want well-documented REST APIs, so that I can integrate the observability platform with other tools and automate workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI specification documentation
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication and authorization consistently
3. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow consistent formatting and error handling patterns
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and retry guidance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Kubernetes platform operator, I want integrated cost monitoring and optimization capabilities, so that I can track, allocate, and optimize Kubernetes infrastructure costs effectively within the unified observability platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL integrate OpenCost for comprehensive Kubernetes cost monitoring and allocation
2. WHEN OpenCost collects data THEN it SHALL gather cost information from cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and on-premises infrastructure
3. WHEN users view cost data THEN the system SHALL display cost breakdowns by namespace, workload, service, and custom labels with proper tenant isolation
4. IF cost anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and provide optimization recommendations through the unified alert system
5. WHEN generating cost reports THEN the system SHALL support chargeback and showback capabilities for multi-tenant environments
6. IF users access cost data THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant isolation ensuring users only see costs for their authorized resources
7. WHEN integrating with existing workflows THEN OpenCost data SHALL be accessible through the unified ObservaStack API and embedded in Grafana dashboards
8. IF deploying in air-gapped environments THEN OpenCost SHALL support offline cost calculation using local pricing data and resource utilization metrics
