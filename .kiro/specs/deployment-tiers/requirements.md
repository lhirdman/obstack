# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ObservaStack offers three distinct deployment tiers to serve different customer segments and use cases. This tiered approach allows customers to choose the right balance of features, complexity, and cost for their specific needs, from simple local installations to full enterprise deployments with comprehensive multi-tenant capabilities.

The three tiers are designed to provide a clear upgrade path, allowing customers to start with simpler deployments and scale up as their needs grow, while maintaining consistent core functionality across all tiers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a small development team, I want a free, one-click local installation of ObservaStack, so that I can quickly set up observability for my local development environment without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the one-click installer THEN the system SHALL deploy a complete observability stack using Docker Compose with minimal configuration
2. WHEN the local installation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide access to logs, metrics, traces, and basic dashboards without requiring external authentication
3. WHEN using the free tier THEN the system SHALL use single-node RedPanda and either single-node OpenSearch or no OpenSearch at all for simplified resource requirements
4. IF the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL use local user management without Keycloak integration
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL be accessible within 5 minutes of running the installation command
6. IF system resources are limited THEN the installation SHALL gracefully degrade by disabling resource-intensive components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SaaS customer, I want to subscribe to a hosted ObservaStack service with monthly billing, so that I can access enterprise observability features without managing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer subscribes to the SaaS tier THEN they SHALL receive access to a fully managed multi-tenant ObservaStack instance
2. WHEN using the SaaS service THEN customers SHALL have access to all features including advanced analytics, alerting, insights, and Kubernetes cost optimization through OpenCost integration
3. WHEN billing occurs THEN the system SHALL charge customers monthly based on their usage tier and data retention requirements
4. IF a customer exceeds their plan limits THEN the system SHALL provide upgrade options and temporary overage allowances
5. WHEN customers access the service THEN they SHALL authenticate through integrated SSO providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
6. IF service issues occur THEN customers SHALL receive SLA-backed support and incident response
7. WHEN customers deploy workloads on Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide cost visibility and optimization recommendations through integrated OpenCost monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an enterprise customer, I want to purchase the full ObservaStack experience for on-premises deployment, so that I can maintain complete control over my observability data while accessing all platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN purchasing the enterprise tier THEN customers SHALL receive the complete ObservaStack with all components including Keycloak, full RedPanda cluster, OpenSearch cluster, and OpenCost for Kubernetes cost monitoring
2. WHEN deploying enterprise tier THEN customers SHALL have the option to use either Docker-based installation scripts or Ansible playbooks for VM/physical server deployment
3. WHEN using enterprise deployment THEN the system SHALL support full multi-tenant capabilities with RBAC and tenant isolation
4. IF customers choose Ansible deployment THEN they SHALL have full customization options for infrastructure configuration including OpenCost deployment and configuration
5. WHEN enterprise customers need support THEN they SHALL receive priority technical support and professional services
6. IF customers require customization THEN the system SHALL support custom integrations and white-label branding options
7. WHEN enterprise customers operate Kubernetes clusters THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive cost visibility, chargeback capabilities, and optimization recommendations through OpenCost integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer evaluating ObservaStack tiers, I want clear feature differentiation between tiers, so that I can choose the appropriate tier for my organization's needs and budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing tiers THEN the system SHALL clearly document which features are available in each tier
2. WHEN using the free tier THEN customers SHALL have access to core observability features but with simplified deployment and no multi-tenancy
3. WHEN using the SaaS tier THEN customers SHALL have access to advanced features, multi-tenancy, and managed infrastructure
4. IF using the enterprise tier THEN customers SHALL have access to all features plus on-premises deployment and customization options
5. WHEN customers want to upgrade THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths between tiers
6. IF customers need specific features THEN the documentation SHALL clearly indicate which tier provides those capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track usage and adoption metrics across all deployment tiers, so that I can make informed decisions about feature development and pricing strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customers use any tier THEN the system SHALL collect anonymized usage metrics (with appropriate consent)
2. WHEN analyzing tier performance THEN the system SHALL track conversion rates from free to paid tiers
3. WHEN evaluating feature usage THEN the system SHALL identify which features drive the most value in each tier
4. IF customers provide feedback THEN the system SHALL correlate feedback with tier usage patterns
5. WHEN planning product development THEN usage data SHALL inform feature prioritization across tiers
6. IF privacy regulations apply THEN all metrics collection SHALL comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a sales representative, I want clear positioning and pricing information for each tier, so that I can effectively guide customers to the appropriate ObservaStack offering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting tier options THEN sales materials SHALL clearly articulate the value proposition of each tier
2. WHEN customers ask about pricing THEN the system SHALL provide transparent pricing information for SaaS and enterprise tiers
3. WHEN demonstrating capabilities THEN each tier SHALL have appropriate demo environments and use cases
4. IF customers have specific requirements THEN the sales process SHALL include technical qualification to recommend the right tier
5. WHEN customers are ready to purchase THEN the system SHALL provide streamlined onboarding processes for each tier
6. IF customers need custom arrangements THEN the enterprise tier SHALL support custom pricing and contract terms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent core functionality across all tiers, so that skills and knowledge transfer seamlessly when customers upgrade between tiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any tier THEN the core user interface and navigation SHALL remain consistent across all deployments
2. WHEN customers upgrade tiers THEN their existing dashboards, queries, and configurations SHALL be compatible
3. WHEN training users THEN the core observability workflows SHALL be identical across tiers
4. IF customers migrate between tiers THEN data export/import capabilities SHALL facilitate smooth transitions
5. WHEN providing documentation THEN core features SHALL be documented consistently across all tiers
6. IF customers use multiple tiers THEN the user experience SHALL be familiar and consistent
